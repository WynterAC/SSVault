#  Mindmap of General Vault OB Structure 
Thank you for providing the details of the previous conversation. The scheme outlined above for an Obsidian vault is indeed structured to support personal knowledge management, web clipping, and academic projects. This structure is designed to be clear, scalable, and capable of handling a variety of information types and workflows.
The **scheme** includes a detailed folder structure, tag categories to classify and retrieve information efficiently, and a set of linking strategies to ensure that all notes and information are interconnected and accessible.
The **folder** structure creates dedicated spaces for different types of content, such as an Inbox for unprocessed notes, a Zettelkasten or Notes folder for permanent, interconnected notes, Literature for academic references, Projects for individual academic work, WebClippings for online resources, Templates for consistent note formatting, and an Archive for inactive but potentially useful materials.
The **tag categories** facilitate quick filtering and searching within the vault, allowing for retrieval of notes based on source, topic, project association, content type, status, priority, timeframe, and review schedules.
**Linking strategies**, including the use of literature notes, project interlinking, Maps of Content (MOCs), backlinking, tag links, threaded discussions, and templates, are geared towards creating a cohesive network of information that reflects the user's thought process and organizational needs.
The example **workflow** provides a practical approach to managing incoming information, processing literature, integrating web clippings, maintaining project folders, and conducting regular reviews to keep the knowledge base current and relevant.
By implementing this Obsidian vault configuration, users can establish a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge management system that supports academic research, project development, and personal learning objectives.
Creating a visual mind map requires graphic design capabilities, which as a text-based AI, I'm unable to provide directly. However, I can describe how you might structure a mind map based on the Obsidian vault configuration provided:
```plaintext
+-- [Obsidian Vault]
    +-- [Inbox]
    |   +-- [Unprocessed Notes]
    +-- [Zettelkasten/Notes]
    |   +-- [Permanent Notes]
    +-- [Literature]
    |   +-- [Articles]
    |   +-- [Books]
    |   +-- [Papers]
    +-- [Projects]
    |   +-- [Project_1]
    |   |   +-- [Notes]
    |   |   +-- [Resources]
    |   |   +-- [Tasks]
    |   +-- [Project_2]
    |   |   +-- [Notes]
    |   |   +-- [Resources]
    |   |   +-- [Tasks]
    |   
    +-- [WebClippings]
    |   +-- [Source Tagged]
    |   +-- [Topic Tagged]
    +-- [Templates]
    |   +-- [Note Formats]

```
### Visual Mindmap of the Vault
If you want to create a visual mind map, you'd usually start with the main concept or node at the center, in this case, "Obsidian Vault." From there, you branch out to the main categories or folders like "Inbox," "Zettelkasten," "Literature," "Projects," etc.
Each of these main branches would then have their sub-branches. For example, "Literature" might have sub-branches for "Articles," "Books," and "Papers." 
Under "Projects," you could have different branches for each project ("Project_1," "Project_2," etc.), and each project would have sub-branches for "Notes," "Resources," and "Tasks."
Tags would also be represented, possibly as clouds or another shape connected to the notes or content they categorize. These could include "Source Tags," "Topic Tags," "Project Tags," and so on.
Linking strategies would be visualized by lines or arrows showing the connections between different notes or concepts within the map.
For actual mind map creation, you would use software like MindMeister, XMind, or even drawing tools like draw.io. These tools provide you with a graphical interface to create nodes, sub-nodes, and connections that represent the structure and relationships of your Obsidian vault.
Creating a text representation of a mind map that can be used with the Obsidian Mind Map plugin involves using an indentation structure where each level of indentation represents a node in the mind map. Here's an example of how you might structure your Obsidian vault information in a format that would be compatible with the plugin:
```markdown
- Obsidian Vault
    - Inbox
        - Unprocessed Notes
    - Zettelkasten/Notes
        - Permanent Notes
    - Literature
        - Articles
        - Books
        - Papers
    - Projects
        - Project_1
            - Notes
            - Resources
            - Tasks
        - Project_2
            - Notes
            - Resources
            - Tasks
        - ...
    - WebClippings
        - Source Tagged
        - Topic Tagged
    - Templates
        - Note Formats
        - Checklists
    - Archive
        - Old Projects
        - Superseded Notes
```
To use this with the Mind Map plugin in Obsidian, you would typically need to create a Markdown note with this content. Make sure you have the Mind Map plugin installed and enabled in Obsidian. Once you've created the note with the above content, you can open the command palette and search for the Mind Map: Open as mind map command, or click the Mind Map button if available on your toolbar, to visualize this structure as a mind map.
Please consult the documentation for the specific Mind Map plugin that you're using for any additional formatting requirements or features, as plugins can be updated with new functionality and syntax requirements over time.
