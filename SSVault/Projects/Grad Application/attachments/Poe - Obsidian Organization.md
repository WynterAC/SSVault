- help me create an obsidian vault structure suitable for note taking from various sources (ie pdf, web article/clips,videos etc). Create an organization/classification system scheme so i can keep track of my notes and make connections automatically. Create a tagging scheme as well for easy organization.
- Creating an effective Obsidian vault structure requires a plan that balances flexibility with organization. Here's a suggestion for a structure that can help you manage and connect notes from various sources like PDFs, web articles, clips, videos, etc.
1. Vault Structure

Inbox

For unprocessed notes and files.


Literature Notes

For processed and summarized notes from various sources.


Permanent Notes

For evergreen notes that contain your insights and are connected to other notes.


Projects

For notes related to specific projects or areas of focus.


Resources

For source files and reference materials.
PDFs
Web Clips
Videos


Templates

For note templates that you can use to maintain consistency.


Attachments

For images, files, and other media attached to your notes.


Archive

For notes and resources that are no longer actively used but might be useful later.


Daily Notes

For daily journaling or logging tasks and thoughts (if you use this feature).



2. Classification System

Each note should start with a metadata block that includes the following:

Title: The main idea of the note.
Date: Date of note creation or modification.
Tags: Relevant to the content (more on this later).
Source: Where the information came from (URL, book title, etc.).
Related: Links to other relevant notes in your vault.



3. Tagging Scheme
Using tags consistently is crucial for finding and connecting notes. Here's a suggested tagging scheme:

#source/pdf for notes taken from PDF documents.
#source/web for notes taken from web articles or clips.
#source/video for notes taken from videos.
#topic/YourTopic (e.g., #topic/psychology, #topic/programming) for subject-specific tags.
#project/YourProjectName for project-specific tags.
#type/literature-note for notes that summarize the source material.
#type/permanent-note for notes with your own insights.
#status/in-progress, #status/complete for tracking the status of a note or project.
#review/weekly, #review/monthly for notes you want to review on a regular basis.

4. Automating Connections

Templates: Create templates for different types of notes with predefined metadata blocks to ensure consistency.
Backlinks: When you mention a concept that has its own note, link to that note. Obsidian will automatically track these as backlinks.
MOCs (Maps of Content): Create index notes for various topics or projects that link to all relevant notes within that category.
Plugins: Use Obsidian plugins such as the Graph View, Tag Pane, and others to help visualize and automate connections between your notes.

Example Note Template:
markdown
- I also want the vault to be used to generate mindmaps of various topics and show/find relationship between concepts. How do i incorporate into the system a hierarchical framework
- Incorporating a hierarchical framework into your Obsidian vault for generating mind maps and finding relationships between concepts can be done by creating a structured note system that reflects the hierarchy of information and by utilizing Obsidian's plugins to visualize these relationships.
1. Hierarchical Note System
A good hierarchical note system in Obsidian might involve a few key types of notes:

Index Notes: Serve as top-level entries for broad topics or categories.
MOC (Map of Content) Notes: Act as mid-level notes that organize and link to various notes within a topic.
Content Notes: The individual notes containing information, ideas, summaries, etc.

For example, you could organize a topic like "Psychology" as follows:

Psychology Index Note (Top level)

MOC: Cognitive Psychology (Mid level)

Content Note: Attention Span Research (Individual note)
Content Note: Memory Models (Individual note)


MOC: Social Psychology (Mid level)

Content Note: Group Dynamics (Individual note)
Content Note: Social Influence (Individual note)





2. Mind Mapping and Visualization


Plugins for Mind Mapping: There are plugins available for Obsidian that can help you create mind maps from your notes, such as the "Mind Map" plugin. You can use these plugins to visualize the structure of your notes and their interconnections.
After installing a mind map plugin, you can use it to create a visual representation of a topic by linking content notes to your MOCs and then to your index notes. This can be done by following the syntax required by the plugin, usually involving creating a bullet point list or a specific type of code block that the plugin can interpret as a mind map.


Graph View: Obsidian's Graph View can also serve as a form of mind map, showing the connections between your notes. By carefully structuring your notes and their links, you can use the Graph View to see a visual hierarchy and connections.
To use the Graph View effectively:

Make sure to link notes appropriately, respecting the hierarchical structure.
Use tags consistently to filter your graph view by topics, types of notes, or any other classification.
Adjust Graph View settings to highlight different types of connections (tags, links, etc.).



3. Tags and Links for Hierarchy


Use specific tags to indicate the level in the hierarchy, e.g., #index, #moc, #content.


Use links to connect lower-level notes to their corresponding MOC, and in turn, link MOCs to the index notes.
For example, in a content note, you could have the following:
markdown
- For the example note above, what tags would it have
- For the example note provided above, which is an "MOC: Cognitive Psychology," the tags could reflect its position in the hierarchy, the subject matter, and its role as a map of content. Here's how the tags might look:
markdown
- Can i also integrate a concept database in the vault
- Absolutely! In Obsidian, creating a "concept database" can be a powerful way to organize and interlink your ideas, theories, and definitions. This approach will enhance the utility of your vault as a knowledge management tool. Here's how you can integrate a concept database into your vault:
1. Creating Concept Notes
For each key concept, create a dedicated note. This note will serve as the central hub for information regarding that concept. The structure of a concept note might include:

A definition of the concept.
Links to related notes, literature notes, and resources.
Examples or case studies illustrating the concept.
A list of related concepts (maybe through tags or direct links).
A changelog if you update your understanding of the concept over time.

2. Linking to Literature and Permanent Notes
Whenever you mention a concept in a literature note or a permanent note, link back to the respective concept note. This ensures that all discussions of a concept can be easily traced back to a central place.
3. Tagging Scheme
Incorporate tags that help identify notes as part of the concept database. For example:

#concept for all concept notes.
#concept/YourSpecificConcept (e.g., #concept/CognitiveDissonance) for tagging specific concept notes.

4. Utilizing MOCs (Maps of Content)
Create MOC notes for different categories or fields of study within your concept database. Link all relevant concept notes to their respective MOCs.
5. Leveraging Obsidian Features
Use features like backlinks and the graph view to see how concepts are interconnected. Consider using community plugins for additional functionality, such as database-like management or improved tagging capabilities.
Example of a Concept Note Structure
markdown
- Why tag it #concept/CognitiveDissonance ? What other notes could i use this tag for
- The tag #concept/CognitiveDissonance in the example serves a couple of purposes within the Obsidian ecosystem:


Specificity: It's a specific tag that uniquely identifies all notes related to "Cognitive Dissonance." This allows you to filter or search for notes that are specifically about this concept and not just any concept.


Hierarchical Tagging: The use of a slash (/) in the tag creates a hierarchical structure within the tagging system. Itâ€™s like creating a subcategory within the broader #concept category. This is useful for organizing your tags and making them more navigable, especially when you have a lot of them.


Interlinking: Tags can help to create an additional layer of connectivity between notes. Any note that explores, discusses, or expands upon the concept of cognitive dissonance could be tagged with #concept/CognitiveDissonance to indicate its relevance to this concept.


Here are some examples of other notes that could use the tag #concept/CognitiveDissonance:


Case Studies or Examples: If you have a note detailing a specific case study where cognitive dissonance played a key role, this tag would be appropriate.


Research Summaries: Notes that summarize academic papers, research findings, or empirical studies about cognitive dissonance should carry this tag to denote their content focus.


Application Notes: These might include notes on how cognitive dissonance theory is applied in marketing, design, user experience, or other fields.


Reflection or Personal Notes: You might have notes where you reflect on your own experiences or observations related to cognitive dissonance. Tagging these with #concept/CognitiveDissonance helps you link personal insights to theoretical understanding.


Related Concepts: Notes about concepts that are closely related to or often discussed in conjunction with cognitive dissonance (like "confirmation bias" or "choice-supportive bias") might also include this tag to show the relationship.


Teaching or Presentation Materials: If you prepare a lecture, a workshop, or a presentation about cognitive dissonance, the materials and outline notes would be tagged accordingly.


By consistently using the tag #concept/CognitiveDissonance across all relevant notes, you create a rich, interconnected web of information that can be easily navigated, especially when looking to understand or review everything you have on that particular concept. This is particularly useful in Obsidian, where tags can be used to filter notes in both the search function and the graph view.
- What would be the difference between tagging it concept/CognitiveDissonance and just CognitiveDissonance
- Using #concept/CognitiveDissonance versus just #CognitiveDissonance as a tag in Obsidian can impact how you organize and retrieve your notes. Here's a breakdown of the differences:
#concept/CognitiveDissonance


Hierarchy: The #concept/ prefix establishes a hierarchical structure. It's clear that the note is part of a broader "concept" category. This is particularly useful if you have a large number of tags and want to keep them organized.


Consistency: Using a prefix like #concept/ helps ensure consistency across tags representing concepts. It's immediately apparent to you (or anyone else using your vault) that any tag with this prefix relates to a concept note.


Filtering: When searching or filtering tags, you can easily filter by the #concept/ prefix to see all concept-related notes, regardless of the specific concept they pertain to. This can be helpful for reviewing all of your concept notes at once.


Scalability: As your vault grows, you might have concepts spread across different domains (e.g., psychology, philosophy, biology). Using #concept/ helps you scale your organizational system without getting overwhelmed.


#CognitiveDissonance


Simplicity: A simple #CognitiveDissonance tag is straightforward and might be quicker to type and remember, especially if you don't have a large number of tags or don't require a hierarchical structure.


Directness: Without the prefix, the tag serves a more direct connection to the topic at hand. It's a flat structure, which means every tag is at the same level, and there's no implied category or hierarchy.


Broad Use: If a note touches on cognitive dissonance but isn't strictly a conceptual exploration (e.g., a personal journal entry or a project plan that refers to cognitive dissonance), you might prefer a more general tag.


Decision Factors
Here are some factors to consider when deciding between the two tagging methods:


Personal Preference: How do you like to organize your notes? Would you prefer a hierarchical system or a flat system?


Volume of Notes: If you have a large number of notes and concepts, a hierarchical tagging system might be more manageable.


Search Habits: Consider how you search for notes. Do you often look for all notes on a particular concept, or do you search for broader categories?


Future Proofing: Think about how your system will scale. What works for a small number of notes might become cumbersome as your database grows.


In practice, you can use both tagging strategies in tandem, as long as you're consistent and it serves your workflow. Some users might start with a flat structure like #CognitiveDissonance and then move to a hierarchical structure like #concept/CognitiveDissonance as their database grows and their organizational needs become more complex.
- Come up with a smarter and more intuitive filing system for my vault
- Creating a smarter and more intuitive filing system for your Obsidian vault can significantly enhance your ability to store, retrieve, and connect information. Below is a suggested system that leverages a combination of folders, naming conventions, and tagging to create a robust knowledge management structure.
Folder Structure

Inbox: For quick capture of new notes, ideas, or information to be processed later.
Zettelkasten: For permanent notesâ€”atomic, interconnected thoughts.
Literature: For notes taken from books, articles, papers, videos, etc.
Projects: For notes related to specific projects, with subfolders for each project.
MOCs (Maps of Content): For index notes that map out and connect various notes within a topic.
Resources: For templates, source files, images, or other media used in notes.
Archive: For outdated or no longer relevant notes.
Daily Notes: If you use daily notes for journaling or as a work log.

Naming Conventions

Use consistent and descriptive titles for your notes.
Include dates in titles where relevant, in YYYY-MM-DD format for easy sorting.
Prefix zettelkasten notes with a unique ID (e.g., 20240223 for a note created on February 23, 2024).
Use CamelCase or dashes to denote spaces in file names (easier for linking in Markdown).

Tagging System

Use hierarchical tags when possible (e.g., #concept/CognitiveDissonance, #project/ProjectName, #literature/AuthorName).
Tag notes with the stage of processing (e.g., #inbox, #toProcess, #toReview).
Use topical tags for easy retrieval (e.g., #psychology, #productivity).
Tag notes by content type (e.g., #permanentNote, #literatureNote, #projectNote).

Linking Strategy

Use wikilinks ([[Note Title]]) to connect ideas within notes.
Link back to MOCs or index notes to maintain a high-level overview.
Utilize backlinks to understand the context of how notes are connected.

Advanced Techniques

Templates: Create templates for different types of notes (literature notes, meeting notes, daily notes) for consistency.
Plugins: Use community plugins for extended functionality like automatic backlinking, graph analysis, or Kanban boards for project management.
Aliases: In YAML frontmatter, use aliases for notes that might be known by different names or acronyms.
Version Control: Consider using a version control system like Git to manage changes and history of your notes.

Inbox

A temporary holding place for unprocessed notes.
Regularly review and move notes to the appropriate permanent location.



Zettelkasten

Contains your permanent, evergreen notes that are atomic (one idea per note) and heavily linked.
Each note should be self-contained and understandable on its own
- Sure. That one way of organization g things. Come up with another way, be more specific on tagging and categorization conventions. This vault will be used for taking notes from various sources including book pdfs, scientific literatures, web clips, etc)
- If you're looking for an alternative way to organize your Obsidian vault, especially for managing diverse types of content such as book PDFs, scientific literature, and web clips, you might consider a system that leans more on tags and metadata for categorization and less on a strict folder hierarchy. This approach is often called a "para" method, which stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.
PARA Method Adaptation
Projects

Active endeavors with a deadline and a goal.
Name convention: P - Project Name

Areas

Ongoing responsibilities without a deadline.
Name convention: A - Area Name

Resources

Reference materials that inform your projects and areas.
Name convention: R - Resource Name

Archives

Inactive items from the other three categories.
Name convention: Arch - Name

Tagging Conventions

Source Tags: #source/Book, #source/Journal, #source/Web.
Content-Type Tags: #type/Summary, #type/Quote, #type/Idea.
Topic Tags: Use broad topics like #topic/Psychology, #topic/Neuroscience.
Subtopic Tags: More specific like #topic/Psychology/Behavioral.
Status Tags: #status/ToRead, #status/Reading, #status/Completed.
Review Tags: #review/Weekly, #review/Monthly, #review/Quarterly.
Priority Tags: #priority/High, #priority/Medium, #priority/Low.

Metadata Conventions

Frontmatter: At the start of each note, include YAML metadata for title, date, tags, and source.
yaml
- Looks good, are there other ways to structure the vault? I also want to use it to generate a personal knowledge database and take notes from various textbooks and journal articles and use them in the future to write literature review
- Certainly! If you're structuring an Obsidian vault with the intent of creating a personal knowledge database and using the information for future literature reviews, you might want to consider a system that emphasizes ease of retrieval, integration of knowledge, and synthesis across different sources. Here's a structure that focuses on these aspects:
Structuring for Literature Reviews
1. Reference Management

Bibliography: Keep a master note or folder for bibliographic entries, possibly using a plugin for citation management.
PDFs: Store PDFs of textbooks and journal articles in a dedicated folder, and consider naming them in a consistent format like AuthorYear_Title.pdf.

2. Note-Taking Strategy

Literature Notes: Create notes for each paper or book chapter you read, summarizing key points and your own thoughts.
Permanent Notes: Distill insights from literature notes into atomic ideas that can stand on their own and contribute to multiple topics.

3. Thematic Organization

Themes: Organize notes by broad themes relevant to your field of study or specific research interests.
Subthemes: Within each theme, create subfolders or tags for narrower topics.

4. Synthesis and Analysis

Concept Notes: Develop notes that aren't tied to a single source but rather synthesize multiple perspectives on a concept.
Argumentation Notes: Create notes where you develop arguments or discussions that might feed into a literature review or research paper.

Tagging and Metadata for Integration

Use a consistent tagging system to indicate themes (#theme/CognitivePsychology), methodologies (#method/QualitativeResearch), or other relevant categorizations.
Include metadata in your notes for cross-referencing, such as links to related literature notes, permanent notes, or concept notes.

Example Structure
markdown
- I like this system! But make sure to incorporate other elements discussed earlier (ie.noting from various sources, concept database, linking notes etc.) and create a hierchical structure and be more specific on tagging conventions
- I'm glad to hear you like the system! To incorporate elements of noting from various sources, building a concept database, and effectively linking notes, let's refine the structure with a hierarchical approach that combines folders and tags for a comprehensive organizational system.
Hierarchical Vault Structure
Top-Level Categories


Sources

Subfolders for each type of source: Books, Journals, Web, etc.
Each entry is a literature note derived from the source material.



Concepts

Stores evergreen, thematic, and concept notes.
Organize by high-level fields of study, then subdivide into specific concepts.



Projects

Active areas of work, such as papers or presentations.
Subfolders for each project with relevant notes and drafts.



Inbox

Initial capture for unsorted notes.
Regularly processed and categorized.



Archive

Inactive projects and outdated notes.
Review periodically for potential insights or deletion.



Specific Folder Structure

- where would i store my web clips or pdfs or Luther sources
- In your Obsidian vault, you'd typically allocate a specific folder for storing web clips, PDFs, and other sources to keep them organized and easily accessible. Let's refine the structure to include these:
Revised Folder Structure for Storing Sources

- Be more specific on what metadata should include.be more specific on hierarchical organization and tagging conventions  And what other properties could be useful. Make an outline of folder structure
- Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of each aspect of the system, including metadata, hierarchical organization, tagging conventions, and a comprehensive outline of the folder structure.
Metadata for Notes
For each note, especially those derived from sources, you should include metadata at the top of the document. Metadata typically includes:

Title: The title of the note, which may also be the title of the source.
Date: The date the note was created or the source was published.
Tags: Relevant tags for quick categorization and retrieval.
Source: The citation for the source material (e.g., author, title, year, publisher, DOI for articles, URL for web pages).
Linked Files: Direct links to the local files or URLs of the source material.
Summary: A brief description or abstract of the note's content.
Keywords: Specific keywords that aren't covered by the tags but are significant for the content.
Status: The current status of the note (e.g., #draft, #review, #final).

Example of metadata for a literature note derived from a journal article:

- How should I organize my folders if I have multiple research projects?
- When managing multiple research projects, it's important to create a clear and scalable folder structure that allows you to compartmentalize and navigate each project efficiently. Below is a suggested outline that you can adjust according to your specific needs.
Suggested Folder Structure for Multiple Research Projects
plaintext
- Can this be incorporated into my vault structure? And also the vault structure seem to be missing concepts database and topics
- Certainly! You can integrate a "Concepts" or "Topics" database into your vault to organize the theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and subject-specific knowledge that span across multiple projects. This can serve as a centralized repository, allowing you to draw connections and reference these concepts within your active research. Here's how you might incorporate these into the previously outlined vault structure:
Revised Vault Structure with Concepts Database and Topics
plaintext
- I mean incorporate the research folder into the previous vault configuration
- Certainly! Let's integrate a "Research" folder into the previously outlined vault configuration while ensuring that we include sections for "Concepts" and "Topics." Here's how the revised structure would look:
Integrated Vault Structure with Research, Concepts, and Topics
plaintext
- Topics and concepts should be in the vault not specific to research folder since they are part of the knowledge base
- Understood. The "Topics" and "Concepts" sections should be part of the broader knowledge base, not confined to the research folder. Here's the updated structure where "Topics" and "Concepts" are accessible at the root level of the vault, making them relevant to all areas, not just research projects.
Updated Vault Structure with Global Access to Topics and Concepts
plaintext
- Is there a recommended way to link related concepts and topics across different sections of the vault?
- Linking related concepts and topics across different sections of your vault is essential for building a rich, interconnected knowledge base. Here's how you can do it effectively:
1. Consistent Naming Conventions
Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your files and folders. This makes it easier to remember and reference related materials.
2. Cross-Referencing
When you mention a concept or topic within a document, create an internal link to the relevant file or section. This could be as simple as [Concept A](../Concepts/FundamentalConcepts/ConceptA.md) or [Topic Area 1](../Topics/TopicArea1/SubtopicX.md). This method allows for easy navigation between related areas.
3. Index or MOC (Map of Content) Files
Create index files or a "Map of Content" (MOC) in each major section, which lists all the documents and a brief description. Include links to these documents. This serves as a central navigation document that can connect various parts of the vault.
4. Tagging System
Implement a tagging system within your documents. For example, at the end of a note or file, you can include tags like #ConceptA or #TopicArea1. This way, you can search for the tag and find all related notes across the vault.
5. Use a Knowledge Management Tool
Employ a tool that supports backlinking and bidirectional linking. Tools like Obsidian, Roam Research, or Logseq are designed with knowledge management in mind and can automatically link and backlink related concepts and topics.
6. Embedding
Some knowledge management tools allow embedding one note within another. For instance, if you are writing about a research method in a project note, you can embed a note from the "Concepts" section that explains the method in more detail.
7. Regular Reviews
Periodically review your notes to update and maintain links. As your knowledge base grows, new connections will emerge that weren't initially apparent.
8. Use Graph Views
If your knowledge management tool offers a graph view (like Obsidian), use it to visualize the connections between your notes. This can help identify gaps or clusters in your knowledge base.
Example of Linking in Markdown:
markdown
- The vault is intended to be used in obsidian! Now be even more detailed in your structuring, add additional sections to the vault that might be useful in creating such knowledge base. Review previously mentioned needs for the vault and make sure the new config has all the aforementioned features in previous messages. In order to avoid early termination, respond in separate messages to create a detail new vault scheme/structure and tagging/naming conventions.
- Let's start with the detailed vault structure for use in Obsidian. Obsidian is a powerful tool for knowledge management because of its support for Markdown, backlinks, graph view, and plugins that can extend its functionality.

- Tagging/Naming Conventions for Obsidian
Using a combination of tags and naming conventions helps maintain organization and makes the retrieval of information more efficient. Here's a system you can implement:
Tags
Tags in Obsidian can be used to group notes by themes, types of content, status, or any other classification you find useful. Use them consistently across your notes to ensure easy searching and filtering. Here's an example of how you might use tags:

#concept for notes related to conceptual ideas.
#topic/TopicName for notes related to specific topics, with TopicName being the name of the topic.
#project/ProjectName for notes related to specific projects.
#meeting for meeting notes.
#literature for literature notes, reviews, and summaries.
#daily for daily notes and logs.
#resource for notes on resources like plugins or tools.
#archive for notes that have been archived.
#todo for items that need action.
#inprogress for items that are currently being worked on.
#completed for items that have been completed.

Naming Conventions
Naming conventions help with sorting and quickly understanding the content of a file without needing to open it. Here are some suggestions:

Projects: YYYY-MM-DD_ProjectName_Title.md - This includes the date, the name of the project, and a short title indicating the note's content.
Literature Notes: AuthorYear_Title.md - This format is useful for academic work, making it easy to cite and reference.
Daily Notes: DailyNote_YYYY-MM-DD.md - Using the date allows for chronological sorting.
Meeting Notes: Meeting_YYYY-MM-DD_ProjectName.md - This identifies the date and the project the meeting was about.
Templates: Template_Type.md - For example, Template_ProjectPlan.md.
Resources: Resource_PluginName.md or Resource_ThemeName.md - Clearly identifies the type of resource.

Folder Naming Conventions

Use numbers to control the order of folders in the file explorer, as shown in the vault structure.
Use clear, descriptive names that immediately convey the folder's content.
Stick to a consistent capitalization rule, like TitleCase for folders and lowercase for tags.

Linking Strategies

Internal Links: Use double brackets [[ ]] to create links to other notes within your vault. For example, [[ProjectA]] would link to the "ProjectA" note.
External Links: For linking external resources, use regular Markdown links [Title](URL).
Hierarchical Links: Consider creating a hierarchy in your links, especially in index or MOC notes, which act as directories to other notes.

Using Aliases
If you have a note with a long title, or if it's known by several names, you can add aliases in the YAML front matter of the note:

- Building upon the foundational aspects of Obsidian and how to leverage tagging, naming conventions, and linking, let's delve into some more nuanced strategies and considerations that can optimize your use of Obsidian.
Advanced Note-Taking Techniques


Zettelkasten Method: Implement the Zettelkasten method in Obsidian by creating atomic notes that are tightly focused on one idea and thoroughly linked to other relevant notes. This encourages a web of knowledge that grows more valuable over time.


MOCs (Maps of Content): Create MOCs to act as directories that don't just list links but also provide context for how notes are connected. This can serve as a higher-level overview of complex subjects.


Literature Notes vs. Permanent Notes: Differentiate between transient literature notes, which are often verbatim extracts or summaries of your sources, and permanent notes, which are your own synthesized ideas and insights that connect to your broader knowledge base.


Utilizing Obsidian for Different Domains


Academic Research: Use Obsidian to manage research projects by integrating literature notes, bibliographies, and outlines for papers or articles.


Personal Knowledge Management (PKM): Organize personal learning, journal entries, and life management systems within Obsidian, taking advantage of its flexibility and privacy.


Creative Writing: Writers can use Obsidian to plot stories, create character sheets, and link narrative threads, taking advantage of the non-linear structure that Obsidian affords.


Obsidian Sync and Mobile Use


Obsidian Sync: If you have Obsidian Sync, use it to keep your vault updated across multiple devices securely.


Mobile App: Use the Obsidian mobile app to capture ideas on the go and review notes whenever you have spare time.


Community and Learning Resources


Obsidian Forum and Discord: Engage with the Obsidian community on their forum or Discord server to get tips, share templates, and find out how others are using the app.


Community Plugins: Explore the community plugins that can add functionality to Obsidian, but be careful not to overload your system with too many plugins.


Tutorials and Courses: Look for tutorials, courses, and YouTube videos that can provide guidance on advanced techniques and best practices.
