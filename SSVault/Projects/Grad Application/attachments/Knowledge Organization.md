# Knowledge Organization
 Knowledge organization is a field of study that deals with how knowledge is categorized, managed, and retrieved. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including library and information science, cognitive psychology, and computer science. The goal is to create systems that allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and use of knowledge. Here are some fundamental concepts and systems that can inform your own scheme for knowledge organization and note-taking:
### 1. Taxonomy
A taxonomy is a hierarchical classification system that organizes concepts or objects into categories and subcategories, usually in a tree structure. In knowledge organization, taxonomies help in understanding how different pieces of information relate to one another.
### 2. Ontology
An ontology goes beyond taxonomy by defining the relationships between different concepts. It includes a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. Ontologies are often used in artificial intelligence to help machines understand context and semantics.
### 3. Folksonomy
Folksonomy is a user-generated system of classifying and organizing online content into different categories by the use of metadata such as tags. Unlike taxonomies, which are often created by experts, folksonomies are created collaboratively by many users and reflect the vocabulary of the general .
### 4. Thesaurus
In knowledge organization, a thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary that lists words that are related conceptually (synonyms, antonyms, broader terms, narrower terms, etc.). It facilitates consistency in information retrieval by standardizing terms.
### 5. Metadata
Metadata is data that provides information about other data. In the context of knowledge organization, it helps with the discovery, management, and retrieval of information. Metadata can include information about the content, context, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data.
### 6. Information Retrieval
This is the science of searching for information within documents and for metadata about documents. It involves the use of search algorithms and indexing to quickly find relevant information within large datasets.
### 7. Knowledge Management Systems
Knowledge management systems (KMS) are IT-based systems developed to support and enhance the organizational processes of knowledge creation, storage/retrieval, transfer, and application. They're used to manage knowledge as a resource and to improve the collaboration among team members.
### 8. Mind Mapping
Mind mapping is a visual form of note-taking that offers an overview of a topic and its complex information. It allows users to arrange ideas or information around a central key word or idea and promotes a free flow of thought.
### 9. Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is a method of note-taking and personal knowledge management that involves creating a slip box of notes, each containing a single piece of information and linked to other related notes in a meaningful way. The goal is to create a web of knowledge that can grow and evolve over time.
### 10. Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)
PKM is a process of collecting, organizing, summarizing, and sharing one's thoughts and insights. It's a disciplined approach to managing the knowledge you acquire and create.
### Developing Your Own Scheme
When developing your own knowledge organization and note-taking scheme, consider the following steps:
- **Define Your Purpose**: Clarify what you want to achieve with your knowledge organization system.
- **Choose Your Tools**: Decide whether you will use digital tools (like Notion, Evernote, or Obsidian), analog tools (like notebooks and index cards), or a combination of both.
- **Develop a Structure**: Create a taxonomy or use tagging for categorization. Decide on a hierarchy and how you will link related information.
- **Implement a Process**: Establish a routine for capturing, reviewing, and organizing new information.
- **Refine Over Time**: Your system should be flexible and adaptable to your changing needs.
Remember, the most effective system is one that makes sense to you and supports the way you think and work. It may take some trial and error to find the right balance, but the effort will enhance your learning and productivity.
Certainly! Taxonomies and ontologies are foundational structures used in organizing knowledge across various fields. Here's how they are applied:
### Taxonomies
Taxonomies are commonly used in libraries, biological sciences, and information systems to classify and organize subjects or objects systematically.
**Libraries and Information Science:**
- **Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC):** Libraries use the DDC system to categorize books on shelves. Each book is assigned a number that corresponds to a subject area, allowing for easy location and retrieval.
- **Library of Congress Classification (LCC):** Similar to DDC, the LCC is used mainly in research and academic libraries for cataloging books and organizing library collections.
**Biological Sciences:**
- **Linnaean Taxonomy:** This is the classic biological classification of living organisms into a hierarchical framework. Organisms are divided into kingdoms, phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species.
**Content Management Systems (CMS):**
- **Website Information Architecture:** Websites use taxonomies to categorize content into sections and subsections, improving user navigation and the findability of information.
### Ontologies
Ontologies are used in more complex knowledge domains where relationships between concepts are as important as the concepts themselves. They are crucial in enabling semantic web technologies, artificial intelligence, and knowledge graphs.
**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Ontologies help in understanding the meaning of words in context, which is crucial for tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interactions.
**Semantic Web:**
- **Resource Description Framework (RDF):** Ontologies form the backbone of RDF, which is a framework for describing resources on the web with metadata. This metadata uses ontologies to define the relationships between objects, enabling linked data and the semantic web.
**Healthcare:**
- **Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine‚ÄîClinical Terms (SNOMED CT):** This is a comprehensive clinical ontology that provides a standardized language for clinical terms, improving the sharing of health information across different systems.
**Enterprise Knowledge Management:**
- **Corporate Ontologies:** Businesses use ontologies to represent knowledge about their processes, products, and organizational structures. These ontologies support knowledge management applications, such as enterprise search, decision support systems, and business intelligence.
**E-Commerce:**
- **Product Ontologies:** Online retailers use ontologies to represent the complex relationships between products, categories, and attributes, enhancing search capabilities and recommendation systems.
### Differences and Synergies
The primary difference between taxonomies and ontologies is the level of complexity in the relationships they represent. Taxonomies typically represent hierarchical relationships, whereas ontologies can represent a multitude of relationship types, including hierarchical, associative, and conditional relationships.
Both taxonomies and ontologies are often used together to create robust knowledge organization systems. For example, within a corporate knowledge management system, a taxonomy might be used to categorize documents into a simple hierarchy (reports, memos, policies), while an ontology could be used to model complex relationships between different business units, employee roles, projects, and corporate goals.
In designing your own knowledge organization system, you might start with a taxonomy to get a basic structure in place and then expand to an ontology as you need to capture and utilize more complex relationships between the pieces of information you're managing.
Using Obsidian as a note-taking app offers many possibilities for implementing a knowledge organization system. Let's define and give examples of how taxonomy, ontology, metadata, and folksonomy could be used within an Obsidian vault:
### Taxonomy in Obsidian
A taxonomy in Obsidian could be a hierarchical structure of folders and subfolders that categorize your notes based on topics, subjects, or any other classification system you decide to use.
**Example:**
- `üìÅ Knowledge Base`
  - `üìÅ Science`
    - `üìÅ Biology`
      - `üìÅ Genetics`
      - `üìÅ Ecology`
    - `üìÅ Physics`
      - `üìÅ Quantum Mechanics`
      - `üìÅ Relativity`
  - `üìÅ Personal Development`
    - `üìÅ Productivity`
    - `üìÅ Mindfulness`
  - `üìÅ Literature`
    - `üìÅ Poetry`
    - `üìÅ Novels`
Each folder represents a category, and subfolders represent subcategories. The depth of this hierarchy will depend on the breadth of your knowledge base and your personal preference for organization.
### Ontology in Obsidian
In Obsidian, an ontology would be reflected in the way you link notes together and the relationships you define between them. This could be done through a combination of linked and unlinked mentions, tags, and more complex structures like MOCs (Maps of Content) or index notes.
**Example:**
- A note titled `Photosynthesis` could have links to `Chlorophyll`, `Carbon Dioxide`, `Water`, and `Glucose`, with each link representing a relationship (e.g., "is involved in", "is a byproduct of").
- You may have index notes like `Biology Concepts` that link to all major biology-related notes, showing their interrelations and providing a high-level overview.
### Metadata in Obsidian
Metadata within Obsidian notes can be explicit, like frontmatter data, or implicit, like tags or note creation/modification dates.
**Example of Frontmatter Metadata:**
```yaml
---
title: Photosynthesis
tags: [biology, cell-processes, plant-life]
author: John Doe
created: 2024-01-20
---
```
This frontmatter at the beginning of a note provides structured metadata that can be used to categorize and retrieve notes based on their content, authorship, or other attributes.
### Folksonomy in Obsidian
Folksonomy in Obsidian would be most closely represented by the use of tags, which are user-generated and not necessarily part of a predefined system. They allow for flexible, personal categorization based on your own vocabulary or the common terms within a community of practice.
**Example:**
- You might tag notes with terms such as `#urgent`, `#inspiration`, or `#read-later`, which reflect your own way of classifying information.
- If you share your Obsidian vault or collaborate with others, the tags used by the group could evolve into a shared vocabulary representing a folksonomy.
Combining these elements effectively can create a powerful personal knowledge management system within Obsidian. Taxonomies provide the basic structure, ontologies add depth to the relationships between knowledge elements, metadata gives additional context and aids in retrieval, and folksonomy allows for personal and communal tagging that adapts organically over time.
When setting up a vault in Obsidian for knowledge management, it is essential to establish a structure that facilitates the retrieval and connection of information. This involves the use of taxonomy (classification system), ontology (relationships among concepts), and folksonomy (user-generated tagging). Here's a guide to developing and implementing these structures effectively:
### 1. Taxonomy (Folder Structure)
Taxonomy in Obsidian can be reflected in the folder structure, which provides a hierarchical organization of notes. You'll want to create main categories that reflect the broad subjects or projects you're working on.
#### Example Folder Structure:
- `üìÅ 01_Projects`
  - `üìÅ P01_Mars_Colony`
  - `üìÅ P02_Quantum_Computing`
- `üìÅ 02_Resources`
  - `üìÅ R01_Books`
  - `üìÅ R02_Articles`
- `üìÅ 03_Meetings`
  - `üìÅ M01_Team`
  - `üìÅ M02_Clients`
- `üìÅ 04_Personal`
  - `üìÅ P01_Journal`
  - `üìÅ P02_Learning`
### 2. Ontology (Note Linking and Structures)
In Obsidian, ontology involves the relationships between notes. This includes using internal links, MOCs (Maps of Content), and index notes to show how concepts are related.
#### Implementing Ontology:
- **Internal Links:** Create direct connections between notes with [[wiki-links]].
- **MOCs/Index Notes:** Develop MOCs or index notes that serve as hubs, linking to various related notes.
- **Templates:** Use templates for specific types of notes to ensure consistent metadata and linking structures.
### 3. Folksonomy (Tagging)
Folksonomy is the practice of tagging content informally and collaboratively. Tags should be consistent and meaningful to the users of the vault.
#### Example Tagging Strategy:
- Use prefixes to denote types or categories: `#proj_MarsColony`, `#res_QuantumTheory`.
- Use specific tags for actions and statuses: `#todo`, `#waitingFor`, `#completed`.
- Tag based on content themes: `#sustainability`, `#innovation`, `#leadership`.
### Implementing Taxonomy, Ontology, and Folksonomy:
#### Consistency
- **Taxonomy:** Maintain a consistent folder naming scheme and hierarchy.
- **Ontology:** Use consistent formats for note titles, links, and references.
- **Folksonomy:** Agree on a tagging syntax and stick to it, avoiding duplicates.
#### Clarity
- **Taxonomy:** Folders should be named clearly to reflect their contents at a glance.
- **Ontology:** Relationships between notes should be clear, with a logical structure.
- **Folksonomy:** Tags should be self-explanatory or documented in a key/index note.
#### Flexibility
- **Taxonomy:** Allow room for the folder structure to grow or be reorganized as needed.
- **Ontology:** Use embedded search queries and unlinked mentions to find connections.
- **Folksonomy:** Encourage the addition of new tags as new themes or needs emerge.
#### Review and Refinement
- Periodically review the folder structure, links, and tags to refine and update the organization. Remove redundant folders, merge similar tags, and update links.
#### User Participation (for Folksonomy)
- If the vault is shared, involve all users in the process of tagging and creating MOCs to ensure that the folksonomy reflects the collective intelligence of the group.
#### Documentation
- Document the taxonomy, ontology, and folksonomy in an easily accessible note for all users to reference and understand the organizational system.
By carefully planning and consistently implementing these structures, you'll create an Obsidian vault that is organized, interconnected, and easily navigable, which will facilitate a more productive and enjoyable knowledge management experience.
Documenting the taxonomy, ontology, and folksonomy of your Obsidian vault is crucial for both personal clarity and collaboration with others. Here are some best practices:
### 1. Create a Dedicated Documentation Note
Start by creating a dedicated note that outlines your organizational system. This note should serve as a guide to your vault's structure and tagging system. You can call it something like "Vault Structure Guide" or "Organizational System."
### 2. Outline Your Taxonomy
In the documentation note, clearly outline the folder hierarchy and the rationale behind it.
- **Folder Structure:** Provide a visual representation or a list of your main folders and subfolders.
- **Naming Conventions:** Explain any naming conventions you use for folders and notes.
- **Folder Purposes:** Describe the purpose of each top-level folder and give examples of the types of notes it contains.
#### Example:
```markdown
# Vault Structure Guide
## Taxonomy: Folder Structure
- `01_Projects`: Contains all notes related to individual projects.
  - `P01_Mars_Colony`: Notes specific to the Mars Colony project.
  - `P02_Quantum_Computing`: Notes specific to the Quantum Computing research.
- `02_Resources`: Educational materials and reference documents.
  - `Books`: Summaries and key takeaways from books.
  - `Articles`: Clippings and annotations from articles.
- `03_Meetings`: Meeting notes, agendas, and minutes.
...
```
### 3. Detail Your Ontology
Explain how notes are interlinked within your vault.
- **Linking Strategy:** Describe how and when to use internal links to connect notes.
- **Maps of Content (MOCs):** Explain the purpose of MOCs in your vault and how to create them.
- **Templates:** If you use templates for specific types of notes, document them and explain how they contribute to the ontology.
#### Example:
```markdown
## Ontology: Note Linking and Structures
### Internal Links
- Use `[[double brackets]]` to link to existing notes when they are mentioned.
- Create new notes via linking when discussing a concept that deserves its own note.
### Maps of Content (MOCs)
- An MOC is a note that serves as a hub for a particular topic or project.
- It includes links to all relevant notes, providing a high-level overview.
### Templates
- Use the `Meeting Notes Template` for all meeting notes to ensure consistency.
...
```
### 4. Clarify Your Folksonomy
Define how tags should be used in your system.
- **Tagging Conventions:** List the tags you've established, along with guidelines for when and how to use them.
- **Tag Categories:** If you use tag prefixes or categories, describe them.
- **Tag Evolution:** Mention how new tags should be created and documented.
#### Example:
```markdown
## Folksonomy: Tagging System
### Tagging Conventions
- Start all project-related tags with `proj_` (e.g., `#proj_MarsColony`).
- Use `todo`, `waitingFor`, and `completed` to track action items.
### Tag Categories
- `#proj_`: Project-specific tags.
- `#res_`: Resource-related tags (e.g., `#res_book`, `#res_article`).
- `#topic_`: Subject matter tags (e.g., `#topic_economics`, `#topic_physics`).
### Tag Evolution
- Create new tags when a recurring theme emerges in multiple notes.
- Document each new tag in this guide.
...
```
### 5. Maintain and Update Documentation
As your vault grows and evolves:
- **Review periodically** to ensure the documentation is up to date.
- **Refine the documentation** as you add, remove, or change aspects of your system.
- **Include a Changelog** if necessary to track significant changes to the documentation.
### 6. Make Documentation Accessible
- Pin the documentation note to the top of your file list or star it for quick access.
- Consider adding a link to this note from your vault's homepage or welcome note.
By following these best practices, you'll create a comprehensive guide to your Obsidian vault's organization. This will make it easier to maintain consistency in your note-taking practices and ensure that you (and any collaborators) can efficiently navigate and utilize the vault.
Tag categories in Obsidian can be designed to reflect different aspects of your notes such as their status, content type, project association, or any other relevant criteria. Here are some example tag categories, along with explanations and potential tags within each category:
### 1. Project Tags
Used to associate notes with specific projects or workstreams.
- `#proj_MarsColony`
- `#proj_WebsiteRedesign`
- `#proj_PhDThesis`
### 2. Status Tags
Indicate the progress or action required for a note.
- `#todo` - Items that need to be done.
- `#inProgress` - Work that is currently underway.
- `#waitingFor` - Tasks that are on hold, waiting for someone or something.
- `#completed` - Items that have been finished.
### 3. Content Type Tags
Classify notes by the type of content they contain.
- `#article` - Notes that summarize or are related to articles.
- `#bookNote` - Notes on books or book summaries.
- `#idea` - Notes that capture spontaneous ideas.
- `#reference` - Informational notes that serve as a reference.
### 4. Context Tags
Provide context about the note's purpose or subject matter.
- `#meeting` - Notes taken during meetings.
- `#research` - Notes related to research topics.
- `#brainstorm` - Notes from brainstorming sessions.
### 5. Priority Tags
Signify the importance or urgency of a note.
- `#urgent` - Tasks or notes that require immediate attention.
- `#highPriority` - Important items that are not necessarily urgent.
- `#lowPriority` - Items that are of lesser importance.
### 6. Timeframe Tags
Indicate when a note is relevant or when an action should take place.
- `#Q1` - Items relevant to the first quarter of the year.
- `#2024` - Notes or tasks that pertain to the year 2024.
- `#someday` - For tasks or ideas without a specific timeframe.
### 7. Relationship Tags
Describe the relationship between notes or how notes interact with each other.
- `#parent` - For a note that acts as a hub or main topic.
- `#child` - For notes that are subtopics or detailed extensions of a parent note.
- `#related` - For notes that are conceptually connected but not hierarchically.
### 8. Personal Tags
Relate to your personal life or self-improvement.
- `#habit` - Notes related to habit tracking or development.
- `#journal` - Personal journal entries.
- `#goal` - Notes about personal goals.
### 9. Miscellaneous Tags
For notes that don't fit neatly into other categories.
- `#misc` - A general tag for miscellaneous notes.
- `#temp` - For temporary notes or information that doesn't require permanent storage.
### 10. Thematic Tags
Reflect themes or specific subjects within notes.
- `#productivity`
- `#wellness`
- `#education`
- `#technology`
When creating tag categories, it's important to think about how you work and what will make it easier for you to retrieve and connect your notes. Use a consistent naming convention to avoid confusion, and remember that your tagging system can evolve over time as your needs change.
Organizing and managing tags in Obsidian is key to maintaining an effective and efficient knowledge management system. Here's a structured approach to managing your tags:
### 1. Develop a Tagging Strategy
Before you begin tagging, develop a strategy that aligns with how you think and what you want to accomplish with your notes. A clear strategy should define:
- **Purpose of Tags:** Decide what you want your tags to represent (e.g., topics, status, projects).
- **Tag Syntax:** Establish a consistent format for tags, like using prefixes (e.g., `#book_`, `#project_`).
- **Tag Granularity:** Determine how specific your tags should be. Avoid overly broad or overly specific tags that won't be useful for filtering notes.
### 2. Use Hierarchical Tags
Obsidian supports hierarchical tags, which means you can create subtags. This is useful for organizing related tags under a broader category.
- Example: `#project/mars-colony` and `#project/website-redesign`. Here, `#project` is the main category, and `mars-colony` and `website-redesign` are sub-projects.
### 3. Limit the Number of Tags
It's easy to get carried away and create too many tags, which can become counterproductive. Try to limit the number of tags by using a controlled vocabulary and periodically reviewing and consolidating your tags.
### 4. Regularly Review and Refactor
Set aside time to review your tags. Look for:
- **Unused or Rarely Used Tags:** If a tag is not serving its purpose, consider removing it.
- **Duplicate or Similar Tags:** Merge tags that have the same meaning or serve the same purpose.
- **Outdated Tags:** Remove or update tags that are no longer relevant.
### 5. Use the Tag Pane
Obsidian has a dedicated tag pane that displays all your tags. Use this to:
- **See All Tags:** Get an overview of your tags to see if they align with your strategy.
- **Access Notes by Tag:** Click on a tag in the tag pane to see all notes associated with it.
- **Discover Tag Patterns:** Identify which tags are most used and if they correlate with your most important or most accessed notes.
### 6. Create a Tag Index or MOC
A "Map of Content" (MOC) or a tag index note can be very helpful. In this note, list your tags and briefly describe what each tag should be used for. This serves as a reference to maintain consistency in your tagging practice.
### 7. Leverage Search and Saved Searches
Use Obsidian's search functionality to combine tags with keywords for powerful queries. You can save these searches for quick access to frequently needed groupings of notes.
### 8. Automate Tagging with Templates and Plugins
- **Templates:** Create note templates that include pre-defined tags for specific types of notes.
- **Plugins:** Utilize community plugins that can help with tag management. For instance, there might be plugins that aid in renaming tags across multiple notes or visualizing tag relationships.
### 9. Avoid Redundancy
If your notes are already well-organized within a folder structure, you might not need to duplicate that structure with tags. Instead, use tags to add metadata that isn't already clear from the note's location or title.
### 10. Educate Collaborators
If you're sharing your Obsidian vault with others, make sure everyone understands and follows the tagging strategy. Consistent use of tags is crucial when collaborating.
By following these best practices for organizing and managing your tags, you'll enhance your ability to retrieve and interconnect information within your Obsidian vault, ultimately fostering a more dynamic and useful personal knowledge base.
