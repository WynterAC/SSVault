#  OB Config
Designing a scheme for an Obsidian vault that utilizes both folders and tags requires careful consideration of how you intend to categorize and relate your information. The goal is to create a taxonomy (classification), ontology (relationships among entities), and folksonomy (user-generated tagging) that are harmonious and enhance the discoverability and organization of your notes.
# V1
## Structure and scheme 
### Taxonomy (Folder Structure)
Taxonomy in Obsidian is often represented by the folder structure, which categorizes notes into a hierarchical system. Here's an example of a folder structure for a personal and professional vault:
```
/ObsidianVault
    /Projects
        /Work
        /Personal
    /Resources
        /Articles
        /Books
        /Papers
    /Meetings
        /2024
        /2023
    /Journals
        /2024
        /2023
    /Ideas
    /Templates
```
### Ontology (Note Relationships)
Ontology involves defining the relationships between the notes within your vault. This includes linking notes, creating MOCs (Maps of Content), and understanding how each piece of content interacts with others. Here's how you might define these relationships:
- **Linking:** Use internal links `[[]]` to connect related notes.
- **MOCs:** Create index notes that serve as central hubs linking to various related notes.
- **Hierarchies:** Define parent-child relationships between notes where necessary.
- **Tags:** Use tags to indicate non-hierarchical relationships or metadata not captured by the folder structure.
### Folksonomy (Tagging System)
Folksonomy allows for the fluid categorization of content by using tags that can cross the boundaries of the taxonomy. Tags can evolve organically, but you should have some guidelines to start with. Here's an example of a tagging system:
- **Project Tags:** `#proj_WorkName`, `#proj_PersonalName`
- **Status Tags:** `#todo`, `#inProgress`, `#completed`
- **Content Tags:** `#article`, `#book`, `#meetingNotes`
- **Context Tags:** `#research`, `#brainstorm`, `#decision`
- **Priority Tags:** `#urgent`, `#highPriority`, `#mediumPriority`, `#lowPriority`
- **Timeframe Tags:** `#Q1`, `#Q2`, `#Q3`, `#Q4`, `#2024`, `#2023`
- **Personal Tags:** `#journal`, `#habit`, `#goal`
- **Miscellaneous Tags:** `#template`, `#resource`, `#idea`
## Implementing the Scheme
1. **Folders:** Utilize folders for broad categorization, separating content by its primary function or domain (e.g., Projects, Resources, Meetings).
2. **Tags:** Use tags to add specific metadata that can appear across different folders. For instance, an `#urgent` tag might be used for a note in Projects, Resources, or Meetings.
3. **Note Titles:** Keep note titles informative and consistent so they can be easily searched and understood.
4. **Links and Backlinks:** Establish connections between notes with links. Use backlinks to understand and navigate these relationships.
5. **MOCs:** For larger categories or projects, create a central MOC that provides an overview and links to all relevant notes.
6. **Templates:** Create templates for recurring types of notes (e.g., Meeting Notes, Project Plans) that include relevant tags and structure.
7. **Review and Adjust:** Regularly review your folder and tag usage to ensure they remain useful and reflect your current needs.
8. **Community Input:** Allow for a degree of organic growth in your folksonomy by incorporating tags that emerge from the way you (and collaborators, if applicable) naturally categorize notes.
9. **Documentation:** Keep a master note or a series of notes that document your taxonomy, ontology, and folksonomy rules and guidelines to maintain consistency, especially if working with a team.
By combining a thoughtfully designed folder structure with a flexible tagging system, you'll create a robust framework for your Obsidian vault that can grow and evolve with your needs. This balanced approach allows for both structured organization and the adaptive categorization of content.
# V2
Creating a scheme for an Obsidian vault that caters to personal knowledge management, web clipping, and academic projects involves establishing a clear and scalable folder structure, a set of tag categories that can capture various metadata, and a linking strategy that connects all pieces of information. Here's a specific scheme for such a use case:
### Folder Structure
```
/ObsidianVault
    /Inbox
    /Zettelkasten (or /Notes)
    /Literature
        /Articles
        /Books
        /Papers
    /Projects
        /Project_1
        /Project_2
        /...
    /WebClippings
    /Templates
    /Archive
```
- **Inbox:** A temporary holding place for unprocessed notes.
- **Zettelkasten (or Notes):** For permanent notes that are thoroughly processed and interconnected.
- **Literature:** To hold notes on literature, organized by type.
- **Projects:** Separate folders for each academic project.
- **WebClippings:** For information clipped from the web.
- **Templates:** Pre-made note formats for different types of content.
- **Archive:** To store notes that are no longer active but might be useful for reference.
### Tag Categories
1. **Source Tags:** To identify where the information came from (e.g., `#pdf`, `#book`, `#web`).
2. **Topic Tags:** For the subject matter of the notes (e.g., `#cognitiveScience`, `#machineLearning`).
3. **Project Tags:** Tags specific to each project (e.g., `#proj_PhDThesis`, `#proj_PaperReview`).
4. **Content Type Tags:** To indicate the nature of the note (e.g., `#summary`, `#quote`, `#idea`).
5. **Status Tags:** To track the progress of notes (e.g., `#toProcess`, `#inProgress`, `#completed`).
6. **Priority Tags:** To mark the importance or urgency (e.g., `#urgent`, `#highPriority`).
7. **Date/Timeframe Tags:** To reference specific times or deadlines (e.g., `#Feb2024`, `#Q1`).
8. **Review Tags:** For periodic review (e.g., `#weeklyReview`, `#monthlyReview`).
### Linking Strategies
1. **Literature Notes to Permanent Notes:** When processing literature notes, link them to permanent notes in your Zettelkasten or Notes folder to build a web of knowledge.
2. **Project Interlinking:** Within a project folder, ensure that all notes are heavily interlinked to represent the relationship and flow of ideas.
3. **MOCs/Index Notes:** Create Map of Content (MOC) notes that serve as directories to other notes within a specific category or project.
4. **Backlinking:** Use backlinks to see how new notes connect to existing ones and to integrate them into the knowledge base.
5. **Tag Links:** In addition to regular tags, use tag links (e.g., `[[#topic]]`) where appropriate to navigate between tagged notes.
6. **Threaded Discussions:** When a series of notes discuss or debate a topic, link them in a threaded manner to reflect the evolution of your thought process.
7. **Templates for Consistency:** Use templates with predefined structures for various note types (e.g., literature summaries, project ideas) to ensure each note includes the necessary links and tags.
### Example Workflow
1. **Inbox Processing:** All new notes start in the Inbox. Process these notes regularly by summarizing the content, tagging, and moving them to the appropriate folders.
2. **Literature Notes:** When reading a PDF or web article, create a literature note that summarizes key points, and tag it with the source and topics.
3. **Zettelkasten/Notes:** Convert literature notes into permanent notes in the Zettelkasten, linking them to other relevant notes, and tagging with broader topic tags.
4. **Projects:** Move notes relevant to specific academic projects into their respective folders. Use project tags to mark their association.
5. **WebClippings:** Tag web clippings with the source and topics, and link them to related notes or MOCs.
6. **Regular Reviews:** Use review tags to revisit and update notes, ensuring the connections and content remain relevant.
7. **Archiving:** Move outdated or superseded notes to the Archive to keep the main system clutter-free.
By following this scheme, your personal knowledge base in Obsidian will be well-organized, making it easier to store, retrieve, and connect pieces of information from different sources for your academic work and other interests.

Each of these templates can be customized to fit your specific needs and workflows. By using templates, you ensure that all relevant aspects of a note are considered and that information is captured in a consistent manner, making it easier to review and connect with other notes in your Obsidian vault.
In Obsidian, buttons can be created using the "Buttons" plugin, which is a third-party plugin that allows users to add custom interactive buttons to their notes. Once the plugin is installed and enabled, you can define buttons in your templates that can perform various actions, such as creating new notes from templates, inserting text, opening URLs, and more.
### Button Template
Below is an example of a template that includes buttons to create various types of notes:
```markdown
# {{title}}
## Quick Actions
```button
name Create Daily Note
type command
action obsidian-advanced-uri:new?vault=myvault&file=Daily%20Notes%2F{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
color blue
```
```button
name Create Literature Note
type command
action obsidian-advanced-uri:new?vault=myvault&template=Literature%20Note&file=Literature%2FNew%20Literature%20Note
color green
```
```button
name Create Project Note
type command
action obsidian-advanced-uri:new?vault=myvault&template=Project%20Note&file=Projects%2FNew%20Project%20Note
color orange
```
```button
name Create Meeting Note
type command
action obsidian-advanced-uri:new?vault=myvault&template=Meeting%20Note&file=Meetings%2F{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}%20Meeting
color red
```
## Overview
- **Purpose:** 
- **Date:** {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}
- **Tags:** 
## Content
Write your content here...
<!-- Add more sections as per your note-taking needs -->
## Tags
#{{tag}}
```
Please note the following points when using this template:
- Replace `myvault` with the name of your Obsidian vault.
- Update the `file` parameter with the correct path where you want new notes to be created.
- The `template` parameter should match the name of your templates for literature notes, project notes, etc.
- Customize the `color` parameter to set the desired color for your buttons.
- The `{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}` will be replaced with the current date when new notes are created.
To use these buttons, you'll need to have the "Buttons" plugin installed and properly configured to recognize these button blocks. The actual commands and URIs used in the `action` parameter may also require the "Advanced URI" plugin or similar functionality depending on what you want the buttons to do. Always refer to the plugins' documentation for the correct syntax and available commands.
Remember, plugins and their features can be updated frequently, so make sure to keep your plugins updated and check the latest documentation for any changes to the syntax or capabilities
```

Creating predefined templates with tags and metadata for various folders helps in organizing your notes and can greatly improve your workflow in Obsidian. Below are examples of templates for different folders such as `Journal`, `Projects`, `Meetings`, `Research`, and `Books`. Each template includes some relevant metadata and tags that are commonly used for each category.
