#  Grad OB 
Creating an organized folder structure and tagging convention is essential for managing the complex process of graduate school search and application. I will outline a structure that can help you keep track of various programs, application requirements, deadlines, and other important information. The suggestion includes a folder structure, a tagging system, and a note template for easy information gathering.
### Folder Structure
Here is a suggested folder structure for organizing your graduate school search and application process:
```plaintext
Graduate School Applications
│
├── Programs Research
│   ├── Program A
│   ├── Program B
│   ├── Program C
│   └── ...
│
├── Entrance Exams
│   ├── GRE
│   ├── TOEFL
│   └── ...
│
├── Application Materials
│   ├── Personal Statements
│   ├── CV_Resume
│   ├── Writing Samples
│   └── Recommendation Letters
│
├── Financial Information
│   ├── Scholarships
│   ├── Assistantships
│   └── Tuition Costs
│
└── Correspondence
    ├── Admissions Offices
    ├── Professors and Advisors
    └── Interview Preparations
```
### Tagging Convention
Use a consistent tagging system to make it easier to search for notes related to specific topics or stages of the application process.
- `#GradSchoolSearch` - General tag for all notes related to the graduate school search
- `#ProgramInfo` - Detailed information about specific programs
- `#ApplicationRequirement` - Details about application requirements for each program
- `#EntranceExam` - Notes related to entrance exams (GRE, TOEFL, etc.)
- `#Deadline` - Application deadlines and important dates
- `#Scholarship` - Information about funding opportunities
- `#Contact` - Notes from correspondence with schools or advisors
- `#Decision` - Notes on decisions or thoughts that affect your program choice
### Note Template for Program Information
For each graduate program you're considering, create a new note within the respective program's folder. Here's a template you can use and customize:
```markdown
---
title: Graduate Program - [University Name] - [Program Name]
tags: [GradSchoolSearch, ProgramInfo, Deadline{{year}}, #Decision]
created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss}}
---
# Graduate Program Information

- **Assistantships/Work-Study Options:** 
## Notes
- **Thoughts/Comments:** 
- **Questions for Admissions:** 
## Tags

```
### Web Clipping for Program Information
If you're using a note-taking application that supports web clipping (such as Evernote, Notion, or OneNote), make use of this feature to quickly save program information from the web to your notes. When you clip information from a university program page, make sure to tag it appropriately so it fits within your established organization system.
By following this structure, tagging convention, and using the provided template, you should be able to create a comprehensive and organized database of information for each graduate program you consider. This will make it easier to compare programs side by side and ensure that you stay on top of application requirements and deadlines.
# Grad Program Search and Track Mindmap/OB
To effectively keep track of application deadlines using the note template, you'll need to be proactive in updating and reviewing the deadlines section regularly. Here's how you can use the template to manage deadlines:
1. **Input Deadlines Immediately**: As soon as you find out the application deadlines for a program, enter them into the note template under the "Application Details" section. Be specific and include dates for early decision, regular decision, and scholarship consideration if they are provided.
2. **Set Reminders**: If your note-taking platform allows for reminders, set a reminder for each deadline. It's often a good idea to set these reminders well in advance (e.g., a month, a week, and a day before the deadline) to give yourself plenty of time to prepare.
3. **Use Tags for Years and Deadlines**: Utilize tags such as `#Deadline2024` (replace with the relevant year) to categorize the notes by application cycle. This way, you can search for all deadlines in a given year.
4. **Review Regularly**: Schedule regular reviews of your deadlines, perhaps on a weekly basis, to ensure you are on track with your application process.
5. **Update Status**: As you complete applications, update the checklist in the note template, and mark the deadlines as complete or pending. If a deadline changes, update the note immediately to reflect the new date.
6. **Highlight Upcoming Deadlines**: Use formatting features like bold text or color highlighting to make upcoming deadlines stand out in your note.
7. **Create a Master Deadlines List**: In addition to having deadlines in each program's note, you may want to create a master list of all application deadlines in a separate note so you can see all upcoming dates at a glance.
Here's an example of how the deadlines section of your note template might look with deadlines and reminders:
```markdown
## Application Details
- **Application Portal:** [Link to portal](#)
- **Requirements Checklist:**
  - [ ] Transcripts
  - [ ] Test Scores (GRE, TOEFL, etc.)
  - [ ] Personal Statement
  - [ ] CV/Resume
  - [ ] Writing Samples
  - [ ] Recommendation Letters
  - [ ] Portfolio (if applicable)
- **Application Fee:** 
- **Deadlines:**
  - **Early Decision:** `2024-11-01` ![](reminder-icon) *(set reminder for 2024-10-01, 2024-10-25, 2024-10-31)*
  - **Regular Decision:** `2025-01-15` ![](reminder-icon) *(set reminder for 2024-12-15, 2025-01-08, 2025-01-14)*
  - **Scholarship Consideration:** `2024-12-01` ![](reminder-icon) *(set reminder for 2024-11-01, 2024-11-24, 2024-11-30)*
## Tags
#GradSchoolSearch #ProgramInfo #Deadline2024 #EarlyDecision #RegularDecision #ScholarshipDeadline
```
By following these steps, you can maintain a clear overview of your application deadlines and ensure that no critical dates are overlooked during the application process.
Creating a master list of all required documents for each graduate program in one view can be done using various tools and methods. If you're using a note-taking application or a personal knowledge management system that supports plugins or data views, you can create a centralized document list. Below are methods for two popular applications, Notion and Obsidian, which support such features.
## Using Obsidian with the Dataview Plugin:
Obsidian is a markdown-based note-taking application that can be extended with community plugins, including Dataview.
1. **Create Individual Notes**: Make an individual note for each program in a specific folder, using the same template.
2. **Add YAML Front Matter**: At the beginning of each note, include YAML front matter with fields for each document type. For example:
```yaml
---
program: Program A
transcripts: true
test_scores: true
personal_statement: false
recommendation_letters: true
application_fee_paid: false
---
```
3. **Install Dataview Plugin**: Install the Dataview plugin from Obsidian's community plugins section.
4. **Create a Dataview Query**: In a new note, create a Dataview query to display a table of all programs and their document status. For example:
```dataview
table transcripts, test_scores, personal_statement, recommendation_letters, application_fee_paid
from "Graduate School Applications/Programs Research"
```
This will generate a table similar to the one described in the Notion example, but within Obsidian.
Using either of these methods, you can create a dynamic master list that allows you to quickly see which documents are required for each program and track your completion of these requirements. Always ensure that your plugins or integrations are up to date and compatible with the version of the application you are using.
When using a tool like Obsidian, YAML front matter can be very helpful for organizing your vault with consistent metadata. Below, I'll provide you with two examples of YAML structures: one for general notes in your vault and another specifically tailored for your graduate application research notes.
### General Vault Note YAML Structure
For general notes in your vault, you might want to include metadata such as the title of the note, the date it was created, the author (if it's a shared vault), tags for easy filtering, and the status of the note (whether it's a draft, needs review, or completed). Here's an example of what that might look like:
```yaml
---
title: "Title of Your Note"
created: "2024-02-24"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["general", "miscellaneous"]
status: "Draft"
---
# Title of Your Note
Your content goes here...
```
### Graduate Application Research YAML Structure
For notes specifically about your graduate application research, you might want to include metadata such as the program name, university, application deadline, application status, and a checklist of required documents. Here's an example:
#OBGradTemplate
```yaml
---
program_name: "Master of Science in Computer Science"
university: "Tech University"
application_deadline: "2024-12-01"
application_status: "In Progress"
required_documents:
  - transcripts: false
  - test_scores: false
  - personal_statement: false
  - recommendation_letters: false
  - application_fee_paid: false
tags: ["grad_applications", "computer_science"]
---
# Graduate Program Application: Master of Science in Computer Science
## University Details
- **University Name:** Tech University
- **Program Website:** [Tech University CS Program](http://www.techuniversity.edu/cs)
## Application Checklist
- [ ] Transcripts
- [ ] Test Scores (GRE, TOEFL, etc.)
- [ ] Personal Statement
- [ ] CV/Resume
- [ ] Recommendation Letters
- [ ] Application Fee
## Other Notes
Your additional notes or thoughts about the program...
```
In this YAML structure, the `required_documents` field is a list with keys representing each document type and boolean values indicating whether you have completed (true) or not completed (false) that part of the application.
With these structures, you can easily query your notes using plugins like Dataview in Obsidian or similar features in other note-taking tools that support YAML front matter. This way, you can create dynamic lists, tables, and overviews of your notes and their associated metadata.
### Adding more field to YAML - Contacts etc. 
Incorporating contact information for faculty members, potential mentors, and general university details into your YAML front matter is a great way to keep all relevant information accessible and organized. Here's how you can extend your YAML structure to include this information:
```yaml
---
title: "Graduate Program Application: Data Science"
date: "2024-02-24"
tags: ["grad_application", "data_science", "2025"]
application_status: "Awaiting Decision"
program_details:
  program_name: "Data Science PhD"
  university_name: "University of Data Insights"
  field_of_study: "Data Science"
  degree: "PhD"
  application_deadline: "2025-01-15"
  application_portal_link: "https://university.edu/apply"
  university_website: "https://university.edu"
  program_website: "https://university.edu/data-science-phd"
university_contact:
  general_inquiries_email: "gradoffice@university.edu"
  general_inquiries_phone: "+1-234-567-8900"
  admissions_office_address: >
    Graduate Admissions Office,
    University of Data Insights,
    123 University Road,
    College Town, ST, 12345
  program_coordinator_email: "data-science-coord@university.edu"
potential_mentors:
  - name: "Dr. Jane Smith"
    email: "janesmith@university.edu"
    research_interests: "Machine Learning, Big Data"
  - name: "Dr. John Doe"
    email: "johndoe@university.edu"
    research_interests: "Data Visualization, Statistical Models"
reminders:
  - check_portal: "2024-03-01"
  - final_decision: "2024-04-15"
---
```
In this example:
- `program_details` encapsulate all the relevant information about the program, including links to the program and university websites.
- `university_contact` provides a structured way to keep general contact details like email, phone number, and physical address for the admissions office.
- `potential_mentors` is a list structure to include multiple faculty members, their contact details, and research interests.
By organizing the data this way, you can easily reference specific pieces of information when needed. For instance, you can quickly find a potential mentor's email to ask a question, or copy the admissions office address to send required documents.
Remember to replace placeholder text with the actual information relevant to your applications, and feel free to adjust the structure to match your needs. The key is to have a consistent format that helps you quickly locate and use the information contained in your notes.
#### Multiple mentors
Including multiple potential mentors with different research interests in your YAML front matter is straightforward. You just need to create a list of mentors within the YAML block, where each mentor is represented by a set of key-value pairs. Here's an example of how you can structure this information: #OBGradTemplate
```yaml
---
title: "Graduate Program Application: Environmental Science"
date: "2024-02-24"
tags: ["grad_application", "environmental_science", "2025"]
application_status: "Drafting"
program_details:
  program_name: "Environmental Science PhD"
  university_name: "University of Eco Studies"
  field_of_study: "Environmental Science"
  degree: "PhD"
  application_deadline: "2025-01-15"
  application_portal_link: "https://university.edu/apply"
  university_website: "https://university.edu"
  program_website: "https://university.edu/environmental-science-phd"
university_contact:
  general_inquiries_email: "gradoffice@university.edu"
  general_inquiries_phone: "+1-234-567-8900"
  admissions_office_address: >
    Graduate Admissions Office,
    University of Eco Studies,
    123 University Road,
    Green Town, ST, 12345
  program_coordinator_email: "eco-science-coord@university.edu"
potential_mentors:
  - name: "Dr. Alice Green"
    email: "alicegreen@university.edu"
    research_interests:
      - "Climate Change"
      - "Conservation Biology"
  - name: "Dr. Bob Blue"
    email: "bobblue@university.edu"
    research_interests:
      - "Marine Ecology"
      - "Sustainable Fisheries"
  - name: "Dr. Carol Cyan"
    email: "carolcyan@university.edu"
    research_interests:
      - "Wetland Restoration"
      - "Environmental Policy"
reminders:
  - check_portal: "2024-03-01"
  - final_decision: "2024-04-15"
---
```
In this extended YAML front matter:
- `potential_mentors` is a list of dictionaries, each containing information about a different mentor.
- Within each dictionary, `name` and `email` are simple key-value pairs, while `research_interests` is a list to accommodate multiple interests for each mentor.
This format allows you to add as many mentors as you need, each with their own set of research interests. It's a clear and structured way to keep track of potential mentors and their areas of expertise, which can be particularly useful when tailoring your application or preparing for interviews.
# Mindmap specific to Graduate program search 
## Grad Search Mindmap v1 
I apologize for the confusion. To review, let's consider the conceptual outline provided earlier for structuring an Obsidian vault as a personal knowledge base for graduate program applications. This structure was not explicitly defined in YAML front matter but was described as an organized system of notes and connections. Here is a recap of the vault's conceptual organization:
### Central Node: Graduate Program Applications
- Acts as the main hub for all application-related notes and resources.
### Sub-Nodes:
#### Personal Information
- CV/Resume
- Personal Statement
- Research Interests
#### Application Components
- Application Forms
- Letters of Recommendation
- Transcripts
- Test Scores (e.g., GRE, TOEFL)
#### Program Details
- Program Name
- Degree Type
- Application Deadlines
- Contact Information
#### University Details
- General Information
- Website Links
- Campus Maps
#### Faculty and Potential Mentors
- Mentor Profiles (with Name, Email, Research Interests, Linked Papers/Work)
- Labs
- Communication Logs (Emails, Meeting Notes, Follow-ups)
#### Application Tracking
- Application Statuses
- Deadlines
- Submitted Documents
#### Research and Notes
- Field-Specific Knowledge
- People-specific Knowledge
- Relevant Articles
- Study Notes
#### Financial Information
- Funding Sources
- Scholarships
- Assistantships
### Connections:
- **Tags (Folksonomy)**: Link related notes across different categories.
- **MOCs (Maps of Content)**: Curated lists or indexes of related notes.
- **Links**: Direct connections between notes, mentors, programs, and application components.
### Workflow:
- **Templates**: For applications, emails, and notes.
- **Task Management**: Checklists, Deadlines.
- **Review Process**: Drafts, Final Submissions.
### Plugins (for extending functionality):
- **Dataview**: For querying and presenting metadata from YAML front matter.
- **Calendar**: For tracking deadlines and important dates.
- **Kanban**: For visual task management.
This conceptual outline provides a high-level view of how an Obsidian vault could be structured to manage knowledge and workflow for graduate program applications. Each of these nodes and sub-nodes would typically be represented as individual notes or folders within Obsidian, with links and tags to create an interconnected system that is both searchable and easy to navigate.

To update your mind map in Obsidian or any other mind mapping tool, you would simply add the new information under the appropriate section or sub-section by following the indentation that represents the hierarchy. As you fill in more information, your mind map will become more detailed and complex, accurately reflecting the wealth of information you've gathered for your grad program search and application process
## Tracking Tasks 
To keep track of progress for each task in the Task List section of your mind map or knowledge base, you can incorporate a system of tags, checkboxes, or status updates directly into your Markdown structure. Here's an example of how you can modify the Task List section to include such progress tracking:
```markdown
# Task List
- **Complete GRE**
    - [ ] Register for GRE
    - [ ] Study Plan
        - [ ] Quantitative Reasoning Prep
        - [ ] Verbal Reasoning Prep
        - [ ] Analytical Writing Prep
    - [ ] Practice Tests
        - [ ] Practice Test 1 (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
        - [ ] Practice Test 2 (Date: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [x] Purchase Study Materials (Completed: YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Request Recommendation Letters**
    - [ ] List Potential Recommenders
        - [ ] Prof. A (Contacted: YYYY-MM-DD, Follow-up: YYYY-MM-DD)
        - [ ] Prof. B (Contacted: YYYY-MM-DD, Follow-up: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Send Personal Statements to Recommenders
    - [ ] Confirm Submission of Letters
- **Draft Personal Statement**
    - [ ] Outline Key Points (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Draft Version 1 (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Collect Feedback on Draft (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Revise for Final Draft (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Update CV/Resume**
    - [ ] Update Academic Achievements (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Add Relevant Work Experience (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Proofread and Format CV (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] Get Feedback from Career Services (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
```
In this structure, square brackets `[]` are used to create checkboxes for tasks. An empty checkbox `[ ]` indicates a task that has not been completed, while a checked box `[x]` indicates a completed task. You can update these checkboxes as you progress through your tasks.
For each task, you can also add due dates, completion dates, and follow-up dates in parentheses. This helps keep track of when things need to be done and when they were completed.
When using Obsidian, you can click on these checkboxes within the preview mode to mark them as completed or incomplete, and your Markdown file will update accordingly.
Additionally, you can use tags to further organize tasks by status or priority. For example:
```markdown
- **Draft Personal Statement**
    - [ ] #in-progress Outline Key Points (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] #waiting Feedback on Draft (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
    - [ ] #urgent Revise for Final Draft (Due: YYYY-MM-DD)
```
With tags, you can filter or search for tasks based on their status or priority, which can be very helpful in a large knowledge base with many tasks.
When you make these updates, whether checking off tasks, adding dates, or tagging, your mind map or list will give you a visual representation of your progress and what still needs to be accomplished in your graduate program search and application process.

- **Personal Development**
  - Relevant online courses or certifications
  - Language proficiency improvement if necessary
  - Soft skills development like communication or leadership
### Deadlines
- **Application Phases**
  - Priority application rounds
  - Rolling admissions periods

By adding these details to each section of your mind map, you ensure a comprehensive understanding of the programs you're interested in and maintain a thorough and organized application process. Remember, the more specific and tailored the information is to your needs and goals, the more useful your mind map will be as a planning and tracking tool.
## Simplified Structure 
For a graduate program search and application tracker, your central theme is the graduate program application process itself. From this central theme, you create main branches for each major category of the process, such as "Grad Program Search," "Application Tracker," "Contacts," "Task List," and "Deadlines." From these main branches, you create sub-branches for more specific elements or tasks, and this can continue to more detailed levels as needed.
Here's a simplified visual representation of how the mind map might be organized in text form:
```
Graduate Program Application Process
|
|-- Grad Program Search
|   |-- Research Areas
|   |   |-- Area 1
|   |   |-- Area 2
|   |   `-- Area 3
|   |
|   |-- Potential Universities
|   |   |-- University 1
|   |   |-- University 2

```
This text representation is linear and hierarchical, while an actual mind map would be more spatial and radial, with lines connecting the sub-topics to their parent nodes and perhaps color-coding or icons for additional organization or emphasis.
In a mind-mapping software or application, these would be visually represented with lines connecting them, and you could expand or collapse the branches to see more or less detail as needed. The visual layout makes it easier to grasp complex information at a glance and see the relationships between different parts of the process.
The beauty of a mind map is in its flexibility; you can rearrange, add, or remove elements as your understanding of the process evolves or as your needs change. It's a living document that grows with your journey through the graduate program search and application process.
# Grad Mindmap based on Spreadsheet 
Certainly! To convert your graduate program search spreadsheet columns into a mind map format, you would start with a central node that represents your graduate program search. From there, you will branch out into major categories, which in this case will be the individual universities you are considering.
Each university will then have its own set of sub-branches that correspond to the columns of your spreadsheet. Below is a simplified textual representation of what this might look like in a mind map. Note that in an actual mind map, these would be visual branches rather than text.

```
In an actual mind map, you would use visual cues such as colors, icons, or different branch styles to differentiate between categories such as "Financials," "Admission Requirements," "Application Materials," and "Program Insights." This will make it easier to navigate the mind map and find the information you need at a glance.
Mind mapping software often allows you to add hyperlinks, attach files, and even integrate with spreadsheets directly, adding a level of interactivity to your map. This way, you can keep the detailed data in your spreadsheet while using the mind map for high-level planning and organization.
Yes, absolutely! Mind maps are highly flexible and can be expanded or refined with additional categories and sub-branches as needed. The purpose of a mind map is to create a visual representation of information that suits your needs and helps you organize your thoughts and data efficiently. Here are some potential additional categories or sub-branches you might consider adding to your mind map:
### Additional Main Categories:
- **Personal Preferences**
  - Geographic preferences (urban vs. rural, climate, etc.)
  - Cultural fit
  - Lifestyle factors (proximity to amenities, transport links)
- **Career Services**
  - Career counseling
  - Internship placement rates
  - Alumni network
- **Student Life**
  - Clubs and organizations
  - Student diversity
  - Events and traditions
#### Example of Adding a New Main Category:
- **Alumni Outcomes**
  - Employment statistics
  - Graduate school continuation rates
  - Average starting salaries

### Additional Sub-Branches:
- **Financials**
  - Cost of living adjustments
  - Scholarship deadlines and requirements
  - Hidden costs (health insurance, student fees)
- **Admission Requirements**
  - Interview requirements
  - Experience requirements (lab work, fieldwork, internships)
- **Application Materials**
  - CV/Resume specifics
  - Portfolio requirements (if applicable)
- **Program Insights**
  - Class size
  - Student testimonials or reviews
  - Notable alumni
#### Example of Expanding a Sub-Branch:
If you wanted to expand on the "Financials" sub-branch under a university, you could add nodes for:
- **Financials**
  - Tuition breakdown (per credit hour, per semester)
  - Payment plan options
  - Scholarships specific to the program or department
  - Cost of textbooks and materials
### Example of Adding a New Sub-Branch to an Existing Category:
- **Research Opportunities**
  - Summer research programs
  - Partnership with industries or other universities
  - Availability of research funding or grants
Remember, the goal is to make the mind map as informative and useful for your purposes as possible. You can continuously update it as you gather more information or as your priorities change. The mind map should be a living document that evolves with your graduate program search process.
### Example of Adding Multiple Sub-Branch to an Existing Category:
Yes, you can add multiple sub-branches to a single category in a mind map. In fact, this is one of the fundamental features of mind maps that makes them so useful for organizing complex information. Each category or node in a mind map can have as many sub-branches as necessary to capture all the relevant details.
Here's an example of how you might add multiple sub-branches to a single category using the "Financials" category from your graduate program search:
```
Financials
|
|-- Tuition
|   |-- In-state: $X per year
|   `-- Out-of-state: $Y per year
|
|-- Fees
|   |-- Application Fee: $Z
|   |-- Lab Fees: $A
|   `-- Technology Fee: $B
|
|-- Funding Opportunities
|   |-- Scholarships
|   |   |-- Scholarship 1: $C
|   |   `-- Scholarship 2: $D
|   |
|   |-- Assistantships
|   |   |-- Teaching Assistantship: Stipend + Tuition Waiver
|   |   `-- Research Assistantship: Stipend + Tuition Waiver
|   |
|   `-- Grants: Grant 1, Grant 2
|
|-- Living Expenses
|   |-- Housing: $E per month
|   |-- Food: $F per month
|   `-- Transportation: $G per month
|
`-- Other Costs
    |-- Textbooks: $H
    |-- Equipment: $I
    `-- Personal: $J
```
This structure allows you to see at a glance all the financial considerations for each university or program you're considering. You can continue to add more sub-branches as you discover additional costs or opportunities associated with each program.
Mind maps are designed to be expanded and can grow in complexity as needed. You can add, remove or rearrange branches and sub-branches at any time to better reflect the information you need to organize.
### More Categories per Program
Certainly! Let's expand on several other categories from your graduate program search to illustrate how each can have multiple sub-branches in a mind map format.

These expanded categories show how you can build a detailed and comprehensive mind map for your graduate program search, with each category containing all the necessary sub-branches that relate to your decision-making process. The mind map can be as detailed or as high-level as you need, and it should evolve as more information becomes available or your requirements change.
## University Spreadsheet
Creating a mind map from a spreadsheet involves organizing the data into a visual structure that branches out from a central idea. Since a mind map is visual and spreadsheets are usually linear, the mind map would represent the information differently. Here's a textual representation of what the mind map might look like based on the columns you've provided:
```
Graduate Schools Information
|
|-- University ABC
|   |-- Address: 123 College Lane, Town, XX, 12345

|       |-- Application Fee Information: [www.collegexyz.edu/apply](www.collegexyz.edu/apply)
|       `-- Required Documents: Transcript, LORs, Essay
```
Each university is a main branch off the central idea ("Graduate Schools Information"), and each sub-branch contains the relevant information from the spreadsheet. Categories such as address, website, contact information, resources, and required documents are further sub-branches that organize the details for each university.
Please note that the links in the text representation above are for illustrative purposes and are not actual URLs.
To create this mind map visually, you would use a mind mapping tool or software, where you can drag and drop these elements and arrange them in a way that visually makes sense to you.

## Faculty Contact spreadsheet
Creating a mind map for faculty or professor contacts involves organizing individual details under each faculty member as the main node. Below is a textual representation of how this mind map might look:
```
Faculty Contacts Information
|
|-- Professor John Doe
|   |-- Prefix: Dr.
|   |-- Position/Title: Associate Professor of Biology
|   |-- Contact
|       |-- Email: johndoe@university.edu
|       |-- Social Media: @profjohndoe

```
Each professor is the main branch off the central idea ("Faculty Contacts Information"), and each sub-branch contains the relevant information from the spreadsheet. Categories such as contact information, work hours, faculty department, education background, career, publications, research interests, personal information, lab name, and research projects are further sub-branches that organize the details for each faculty member.
When visually creating this mind map using a tool, you would start with a central node and create individual branches for each faculty member, then add sub-branches for their detailed information, creating a structured and easy-to-navigate profile for each person.
## Labs and Contacts Spreadsheet
When organizing lab information in a mind map, each lab becomes a central node, branching out to detail the attributes associated with it, including the university, associated persons (who would themselves be linked to their individual contact information), and other details. Here's a textual representation of what the mind map might look like:
```
Laboratory Information
|
|-- The Doe Research Laboratory
|   |-- University: University ABC
|   |-- Associated Persons
|       |-- Professor John Doe
|       |   |-- Contact Details: [Link to Professor John Doe's contact mind map node]
|       `-- Other Associated Staff/Researchers
|           |-- Contact Details: [Link to their contact mind map nodes]
|   |-- Website: [www.doelabresearchabc.edu](http://www.doelabresearchabc.edu)
|   |-- Description: A leading lab in CRISPR technology and genetic editing
|   |-- Projects
|       |-- Current Project: CRISPR-based Gene Therapy for Disease X
|       `-- Past Project: Genetic Sequencing of Species Y
|
|-- Smith AI Innovations Lab
|   |-- University: Tech University XYZ
|   |-- Associated Persons
|       |-- Professor Jane Smith
|       |   |-- Contact Details: [Link to Professor Jane Smith's contact mind map node]
|       `-- Other Associated Staff/Researchers
|           |-- Contact Details: [Link to their contact mind map nodes]
|   |-- Website: [www.smithaiinnovations.xyz.edu](http://www.smithaiinnovations.xyz.edu)
|   |-- Description: Advanced research in machine learning and data security
|   |-- Projects
|       |-- Current Project: Secure Machine Learning Algorithms
|       `-- Past Project: Data Encryption Techniques
```
In a visual mind map:
1. Each lab name would be a main node.
2. Sub-nodes would include:
   - University: Listing the institution the lab is affiliated with.
   - Associated Persons: Links to individual contact mind maps or sections for each person.
   - Website: URL of the lab's website.
   - Description: A brief overview of the lab's focus and mission.
   - Current project: Details about ongoing research.
   - Past project: Information about research that has been completed.
For the associated persons, you would want to have a clear link or path that connects them to their respective contact information detailed in the professors or faculty contacts mind map. This could be done visually by lines or arrows pointing to the relevant nodes, or by embedding hyperlinks if your mind mapping software supports it. This way, the lab mind map can serve as a hub for detailed lab and contact information.
### More details
To provide more details for the labs mind map, we can expand on each lab's attributes and offer suggestions on how to link associated persons and projects to the respective labs. Here's a more detailed textual breakdown of what a more comprehensive mind map might include:
