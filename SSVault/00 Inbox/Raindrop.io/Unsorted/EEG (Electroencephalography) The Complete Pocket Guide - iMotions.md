> In the 10-20 system, electrode names begin with one or two letters indicating the general brain region or lobes where the electrode is placed (Fp = fronto-polar; F = frontal; C = central; P parietal; O = occipital; T = temporal).

> However, typical surface-based EEG paradigms do well with 32 channels or less. It is recommended to start small and then expand as you gain expertise and knowledge.

> Event-related EEG paradigms present stimuli repeatedly – 100 times or more, for example. At the same time, stimuli are shown just very briefly for 200 to 1000 ms.

> ERP designs are limited to a specific set of brain activity triggered by sensory stimuli. However, the brain is a continuous oscillator and generates rhythmic activity even in the complete absence of stimuli – during sleep, for example.

> In order to tap into the brain activity that drives our behavior, our thoughts, motivations and emotions, a different analytic approach is required, which is based on the analysis of frequencies.

> However, frequency-based analyses come with a cost: In contrast to ERP designs that allow insights into millisecond changes of voltages, frequency-based EEG measures have much less time precision
