> An open system may interact with its environment in a growth
&gt;or balancing fashion. Often the time of influence of the open
&gt;system on the environment or the environment on the system may
&gt;be of such lengthy duration or of such minimal nature as to limit
&gt;its need to be considered.

> Any system taken in a large enough context can be considered
&gt;a closed system. It is often more appropriate to consider a system
&gt;as a subsystem of some larger system with which it must interact
&gt;in some way.
