> Systems Thinking embodies a world-view.
&gt;A world-view which implies that the foundation for understanding
&gt;lies in interpreting interrelationships within systems.

> Interrelationships
&gt;which are responsible for the manner in which systems operate.
&gt;Interrelationships which result in the patterns of behavior and
&gt;events we perceive.

> The intent of investigating systems is to develop understanding.
&gt;Often the understanding is an emergent result of trial and error.
&gt;If the desired understanding isn&#39;t developing try expanding or
&gt;contracting the domain of consideration.

> It is also important to realize that reinforcing loops can
&gt;create either growth or decline. Which is the case depends on
&gt;whether the interactions are increasing or decreasing the parts
&gt;of the system they influence

> It is also important to note that there may be delays, possibly
&gt;of different durations, associated with the interactions between
&gt;the parts of a system. These delays will determine the length
&gt;of time it takes for the characteristics of the structure to become
&gt;evident.

> As I understand Bertalanffy&#39;s initial premise it was that there
&gt;are fundamental structures which act across all branches of science.
&gt;And, if one learns the structures, when transferring from one
&gt;discipline to another, much of the learning could be transferred.

> You can consider the balancing and reinforcing structures as
&gt;building blocks which can be combined in numerous ways to describe
&gt;more intricate interactions.
