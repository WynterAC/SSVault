&gt;The indication is that resources is a constant within the
&gt;structure being considered so it neither adds to nor subtracts
&gt;from, it just is. You might think of a constant as a catalyst
&gt;for the result.

&gt;The balance in the center of the loop is your indication that
&gt;the loop is a balancing loop.

&gt;you need to do is count the number of minus signs around the loop.
&gt;If there is an even number, or zero, minus signs then it is a
&gt;reinforcing loop. If there is an odd number of minus signs then
&gt;it&#39;s a balancing loop.
