> The content of conscious experience (11) is then viewed as being processed through a recurrent horizontal network of cortical pyramidal neurons with long-distance connections assembling thalamocortical regions, particularly prefrontal and higher association areas, parietotemporal and cingulate cortices (12) referred to here as GNW circuits (8,9

> hypothesis will thus be that such mobilization of the GNW circuits constitutes an objective sign of access to consciousness (8). This is in contrast with the subliminal mobilization of underlying automatic and nonconscious processors

> After 24 wk, thalamocortical axons grow into the somatosensory, auditory, visual, and frontal cortices and the pathways mediating pain perception become functional around the 29-30 wk (18)

> From approximately 34 wk, a synchrony of the EEG rhythm of the two hemispheres becomes detectable at the same time as long-range callosal connections, and thus the GNW circuits, are established (18–20)

> the vertical brain stem, diencephalic, and thalamocortical pathways, which regulate the states of consciousness, become established before their connection with the horizontal GNW cortical circuits yielding, in the newborn, plausibly functional, though still immature, neural dispositions for access to a conscious content.

> Soon before or around birth depending on the brain area, GABA becomes the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. This is a consequence of the expression of the K+/Cl− cotransporter KCC2 that creates a low intracellular Cl− concentration
