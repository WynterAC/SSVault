# A metric for the cognitive map: found at last?

A network of brain areas collectively represent location, but the underlying nature
of this ‘cognitive map’ has remained elusive. A recent study reports that the activity
patterns of some entorhinal cortical neurons form a remarkably regular array of evenly
spaced peaks across the surface of the environment. These ‘grid cells’ might be the
basis of a metric used for calculating position, and their discovery could greatly
advance our understanding of how navigational computations are performed.
