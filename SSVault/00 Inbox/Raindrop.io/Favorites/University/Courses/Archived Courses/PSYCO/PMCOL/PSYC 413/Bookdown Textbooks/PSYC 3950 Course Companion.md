> PSYC 3950 Research Methods and Data Analysis in Psychology III will cover advanced research methods, including survey methods, and supporting statistical concepts and techniques. Designs will include single factor designs and multi-factor designs with both random and fixed factors. Supporting statistical concepts will include analysis of variance (ANOVA) from a linear model perspective, statistical power, and multiple regression, including model building. There may be a general introduction to multivariate statistical techniques. Ethical issues in research will be discussed in detail. Students will be required to design and carry out at least one research project from the design to the writeup stage, including an ethics review. (Grenfell Calendar)
