> The Dataset
&gt;We are using data from the National Morbidity and Mortality Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS). To make the plots manageable we are limiting the data to Chicago and 1997–2000. For more detail on this data set, consult Roger Peng’s book Statistical Methods in Environmental Epidemiology with R.
&gt;You can download the data we are using during this tutorial here (but you don’t have to).
&gt;We can import the data into our R session for example with read_csv() from the {readr} package. To access the data later, we are storing it in a variable called chic by using the assignment arrow &lt;-.
