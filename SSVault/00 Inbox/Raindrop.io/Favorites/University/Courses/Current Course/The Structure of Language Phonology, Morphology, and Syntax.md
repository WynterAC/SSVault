# The Structure of Language: Phonology, Morphology, and Syntax

In the last post, I talked about language–what it is, and some differences between human and animal communication. Studying language…

> For example, consider the words, “bat” and “pat.” In English, these are two different words, even though the beginning sounds are very similar. The sound for the letter “b” is considered to be meaningfully different from the sound for the letter “p”–adding these 2 sounds to “at” makes 2 different words. So, the sound of the letter “b” and the sound of the letter “p” are both phonemes in English

> Technically, phonemes are written with slanted lines on each side of the sound, like this /b/ and non-phonemes are written with brackets, like this [b]

> Morphology is the study of meaningful sound sequences. This includes things like the tense of verbs (like the difference between “typing” and “typed”), plurals (like “cat” and “cats”), and compound words (like “lighthouse”).
