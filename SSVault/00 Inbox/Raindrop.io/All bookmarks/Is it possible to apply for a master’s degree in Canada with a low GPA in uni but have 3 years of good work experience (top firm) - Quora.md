> Can I get into a master’s at a Canadian university with a CGPA lower than 3?Hey mate. it’s nearly impossible. because what i learn through many people : sometimes you can get admitted with 2.9 CGPA( if you have luck or if you have things like- Research paper, Job experience (2 years), extra curricular activities) sometimes you can’t with 3.7 CGPA (Mid rank university-possible). But below 2.9 is nearly impossible. Not a single prof. will give you positive feedback. Some advise: Try Germany, Belgium,UK, Norway, France,Ireland OR {Australia(all they care is money)} (I will try to get into a master’s program between those countries in 2019–2020) . Or if you take GRE, try USa. A good GRE score may give you partial fundings. also USA prof. are more smart. They understand a student situation. GOOD luck. Note: Don’t lose hope. as this is my last smstr , my final CGPA will be 2.73–2.78. see you are not the only one. Cheers :) XD
