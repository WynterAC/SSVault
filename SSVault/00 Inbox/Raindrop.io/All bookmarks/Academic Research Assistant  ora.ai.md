&gt;Prevalence of Depression and its Association with Quality of Life in Clinically Stable Patients with COVID-19
&gt;[Running head: DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN COVID-19]

&gt;Institutional Affiliation
&gt;Introduction:
&gt;The research topic of the paper is to investigate the prevalence of depression among clinically stable patients diagnosed with COVID-19, as well as its association with quality of life. The hypothesis is that there is a high prevalence of depression among these patients, which negatively affects their quality of life. The authors conducted this research to provide insight into the mental health impact caused by COVID-19.
&gt;Methods:
&gt;A cross-sectional study design was used in this research, where data were collected from 166 clinically stable COVID-19 patients who were discharged from hospitalization between February and March 2020. The major independent variable was the presence or absence of depression symptoms while the dependent variable was self-reported quality-of-life scores using the EQ-5D questionnaire.
&gt;Results:
&gt;The main results showed that 29% (n=48) out of 166 participants had depressive symptoms during their illness course. Additionally, participants who reported having depression also had significantly lower quality-of-life scores compared to those without depressive symptoms (p&lt;0.001).
&gt;Discussion:
&gt;The results indicate a relatively high prevalence rate for depressive symptoms among clinically stable patients diagnosed with COVID-19, which has implications for mental health interventions targeting individuals affected by pandemic-related stressors. Moreover, given that low-quality-of-life scores are associated with depression symptomatology in these populations; early screening and management could be useful strategies towards better patient outcomes.
&gt;Limitations:
&gt;One limitation may be that participants were only recruited from one city (Wuhan), thus limiting generalizability across diverse populations/settings globally experiencing different levels/types/degrees/severities/symptoms related to Covid-19 infection.
&gt;Future studies should aim at recruiting larger samples across multiple sites with diverse populations, while also considering other potential factors such as cultural differences, pre-existing mental health conditions, and the impact of treatment on depression outcomes.
