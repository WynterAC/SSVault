## v3: Here is a detailed expanded outline of the key arguments and evidence from the two texts:
Confessions_ A New Transl. Augustine & Sarah Ruden.pdf
		I. Augustine's spiritual journey and conversion to Christianity
			A. His sinful youth and indulgence in worldly pleasures
				1. Evidence: Descriptions of his sexual desires, greed, vanity, and immoral behavior as a young man in Carthage and Rome
				2. Seeing the emptiness of temporal pleasures and ambition
			B. His intellectual journey and dissatisfaction with Manichaeism and Neoplatonism  
				1. Evidence: Seeking understanding through philosophy, astrology, and controversy with the Manichees, but finding them unable to answer his questions satisfactorily
				2. Recognizing the limits of human reason alone to find truth
			C. Listening to the preaching of Ambrose and studying Scripture
				1. Evidence: Ambrose's sermons opened his mind to understand Scripture spiritually and allegorically
				2. Scripture provided wisdom unlike any secular learning or philosophy
			D. Conversion after hearing a divine call to "take up and read" Romans
				1. Evidence: The "tolle lege" experience led him to renounce his former way of life
				2. Submission to the will of God and embracing the Christian faith
		II. The nature of memory, time, creation, and God
			A. The enigma of memory and time  
				1. Evidence: Paradox of remembering past events that no longer exist and anticipating the future not yet here
				2. Time as a distention of the mind, stretching out into the past and future
			B. The creation of the universe and time 
				1. Evidence: Reflections on the opening verses of Genesis - God created the heavens, earth, and light
				2. God created time and is therefore outside of time in eternity
			C. The incomprehensibility yet necessity of God
				1. Evidence: We cannot fully understand an infinite, eternal God, but His existence is proven by the fact of creation
				2. Without an unchanging, immaterial First Cause, reason cannot account for the world  
			D. The problem of evil
				1. Evidence: From whence does evil arise if God made all things good? It must be a privation or corruption of the good.
				2. The cause of moral evil is in the free will of created beings 
	III. The nature of true happiness and virtue
		A. Happiness is found in loving God above all things
			1. Evidence: "You have made us for yourself O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you." 
		B. The insufficiency of temporal success and pleasure to satisfy the soul
			1. Evidence: Examples from Roman history of those with fame and fortune suffering miserably
			2. True joy comes from the hope of eternal life in God
		C. The development of virtue and spiritual disciplines  
			1. Evidence: Through prayer, fasting, almsgiving, and studying Scripture, his soul learned to reject temptation and sin
			2. Progressing in holiness by God's grace working in free cooperation with the human will
	IV. The supremacy of divine revelation and wisdom 
		A. The authority of Scripture
			1. Evidence: Revealed truths like the Trinity could not be reached through reason alone 
			2. Even the obscure and symbolic parts of Scripture convey profound mysteries
		B. Defending orthodox Christianity from heresies like Manichaeism and Donatism
			1. Evidence: Refuting contrary beliefs rationally from Scripture and Church teaching
			2. Upholding Church authority as the guardian of revealed truth
		C. The insufficiency of secular learning apart from divine wisdom
			1. Evidence: Contrasting the fame of secular authors with the lasting significance of the Biblical patriarchs and prophets
			2. True philosophy seeks the wisdom that comes from God and leads to Him
Pensées (Blaise Pascal).pdf
	I. The contradictions of the human condition
		A. Man's dual nature of greatness and wretchedness
			1. Evidence: We strive for infinity but are limited by mortality; we have an idea of perfection but are imperfect
			2. Our glory as made in God's image alongside our falleness into sin
		B. The vanity of worldly life and diversion 
			1. Evidence: Without God, we seek distraction in entertainment, power, and carnal pleasures to avoid facing reality
			2. This demonstrates the emptiness and nothingness of life without recognizing our Creator
		C. The paradox of the human mind and heart
			1. Evidence: Our mind seeks reason yet is weak and liable to delusion; our heart seeks happiness yet is restless
			2. True wisdom and joy come from humbly acknowledging our dependence on God
	II. The case for Christian faith 
		A. Our innate desire for God and inability to find lasting fulfillment apart from Him
			1. Evidence: Natural human desires like relationships, esteem, and immortality reflect our creation for God
			2. But sin has corrupted us and separated us from knowing and loving Him as we ought
		B. The historical evidence for Scripture and Jesus Christ as Redeemer
			1. Evidence: Ancient prophecies, Christ's miracles, martyrs willing to die for witnessing His resurrection  
			2. The perpetuity of the Church and conversion of the pagan world attest divine favor
		C. The unique ability of Christian teaching to explain the human condition
			1. Evidence: Other religions cannot account for both our original greatness and present wretchedness
			2. Only the Incarnation of Jesus reconciles God's justice with His mercy toward sinners
		D. The necessity of making a wager given our choice of beliefs 
			1. Evidence: We must bet our life on something in the face of uncertainty - no reasonable option but to live as if Christianity is true
			2. Though faith is above reason, it is not contrary to reason in light of Christ's signs and the testimony of His disciples  
	III. Approaches to persuasive apologetics
		A. Appealing to Scripture, miracles, prophecies, and witnesses as external evidence
			1. Evidence: These motives of credibility make belief in Christ reasonable even if not rationally demonstrable 
		B. Exposing the contradictions of unbelief and competing worldviews
			1. Evidence: Neither pure skepticism nor reason without faith can explain origins or offer definitive meaning
			2. Most heresies derive from deism, materialism, or exalting reason over God's revelation
		C. Awakening the heart's existential hunger for God 
			1. Evidence: Our desire for eternity witnesses to immortality; sin's corruption requires a Redeemer
			2. Thus Christ uniquely fulfills both humanity's emotional and intellectual needs 
## v4: Here is a detailed outline focused on the theme of diversion/distraction in Augustine's Confessions and Pascal's Pensées:
I. Augustine's Confessions
	A. Augustine's own experience of diversion and distraction from God in his youth
		Evidence: "The love of loving and of being loved inflamed my soul" (2.2)
		"In the grip of desire for profit and ambition I plunged into all those activities ill-befitting my true self and neglected the reason why I had come to Carthage at all" (3.1)
	B. The emptiness of diversion, ambition, and carnal pleasure
		Evidence: "The ambitions that accompany high office afflicted my eyes with searing soreness and destroyed the freshness which is the best quality of life" (6.7)
		"I had played the fool, driven by a desire for vulgar glory" (8.7)
	C. Conversion as turning from distractions to seek God alone
		Evidence: "Now, now, let it be now! O Lord, my God, let my life's purpose absorb me and draw me to you!" (8.12)
		Renouncing teaching rhetoric as mere "traffic in articulate vanities" to focus on wisdom and truth (9.4)
II. Pascal's Pensées
	A. Diversion as flight from facing the human condition
		Evidence: Without God, man seeks only to avoid ennui through entertainment, business, and passionate pursuits (139)
		But this demonstrates that man knows he is miserable apart from God (171)
	B. The deceptiveness of diversion
		Evidence: Diversions often appear good but harm us by preventing self-reflection (171)
		Riches, honor, learning, etc. cannot remedy our wretchedness (183)
	C. Overcoming distraction through awareness of our fallenness and need for God
		Evidence: Recognizing that the desire for diversion reveals how "capricious" life is without God (139)
		True happiness found in loving God who alone can satisfy our restless hearts (501)
	D. Critique of those who promote diversions
		Evidence: While claiming to offer wisdom, secular philosophies glorify diversions that perpetuate ignorance (425)
		Leaders provide entertainments to prevent people from contemplating their condition (142)
- In sum, both Augustine and Pascal argue diversion is a flight from facing reality, driven by our post-fall condition. While appearing harmless or even good, it ultimately separates us further from divine truth and happiness. Overcoming distraction requires recognizing our need for God.
