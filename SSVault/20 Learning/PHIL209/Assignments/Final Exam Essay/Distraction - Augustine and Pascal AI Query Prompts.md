		- Overcoming Distraction and Diversion
			The themes of distraction, diversion and escaping from boredom are prevalent across multiple texts we have studied this term, including Augustine's Confessions and Pascal's Pensées. Both authors provide astute psychological insights into why humans fall into frivolous diversions and entertainments, while arguing that overcoming this tendency is essential to spiritual and philosophical enlightenment. By examining Augustine and Pascal's perspectives on the causes of diversion and how to transcend it, we can better understand the human proclivity toward restless distraction and the discipline required to lead more focused, meaningful lives.
			For Augustine, our appetite for diversion stems from the fallen nature of human psychology and the inability to control our disordered loves. As a result of original sin, "the mind commands the body and it obeys instantly; the mind commands itself and is resisted" (Confessions VIII.9). Our will is divided between love of eternal spiritual goods, and the temporal goods of the material world which we experience through the senses. This renders us unable to wholeheartedly devote ourselves to God and truth. The material world constantly distracts us with exciting novelties, which provide momentary pleasure but cannot satisfy: "The desire for such things attacks the eyes of the mind...and cuts off its freedom to see the light that would show them as they truly are" (VII.16). Unless we develop self-discipline through God's grace, our minds remain forever restless, indulging fickle curiosities and vain ambitions rather than steadfast contemplation.
			Pascal diagnoses similar tendencies toward diversion, which he attributes to human wretchedness and inability to face the "final things" of existence. He writes, "Being unable to cure death, wretchedness and ignorance, men have decided, in order to be happy, not to think about such things" (Thoughts #165). We occupy ourselves with entertainment, luxury, and idle talk to avoid stark truths about mortality and existential uncertainty. Seeking distraction is easier than confronting difficult philosophical and spiritual questions. According to Pascal, philosophy itself is often "no more than a search for vain curiosities" rather than existential wisdom, because philosophers would "like to be admired and refuse to admit their ignorance" (Thoughts #84). True philosophy requires humble self-critique rather than prideful diversion into intellectual puzzles and skepticism. For Pascal, overcoming frivolity further necessitates grace and faith, which give access to divine charity and meaning beyond ephemeral worldly affairs.
			Augustine and Pascal both compellingly articulate the human tendency to avoid spiritual questions and meaningful inquiry by chasing shallow amusements, curiosities and sensory stimulation. They diagnose similar psychological mechanisms by which our fallen nature becomes distracted - our divided will, pride, and unwillingness to confront existential questions. Their prescription is also similar; we must humbly submit ourselves to God's grace and develop greater discipline over our chaotic passions and desires. Both philosophers see overcoming our appetite for diversion and entertainment as essential to the pursuit of truth and wisdom. Their insights remain highly relevant in our own age where endless technology-enabled distractions compete unceasingly for our attention, and thorough, sustained thought is increasingly rare. Heeding their warnings about diversion is vital for anyone seeking to lead a focused, examined and meaningful life.
